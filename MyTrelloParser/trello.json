The standard approach to getting through resistance is to communicate a compelling vision to get people inspired.\n\nFacilitators take a very different approach to managing resistance: they engage people in honest dialogue about why they're stuck, and then support them while they identify what they need to be able to move forward. \n\nIf your project encounters resistance and you want to really find out why people are pushing back, consider having a conversation based on the following agenda. It works with a small group, but is actually more effective if you can get more than twenty people to take part.\n\nResistance model\n\nExplain that the people impacted by change react to it in the following four ways. Identifying exactly what people are resisting and at what level, opens the door to finding solutions that help unblock resistance to change.\n\n1. Commitment—Bought In. “Let's go!!”\n2. Exploration—Open. “I'm willing to try.”\n3. Resistance—Actively work against change. “I will not help with change.”\n4. Denial—Ignore change. “It will go away.”\n\nStructured Conversation 18—Project Adjournment"

These tools also increase the objectivity of discussions because they encourage people to think analytically about all aspects of an issue.\n\n**Facilitative Listening**\n\nStep 1: Announce that you will be asking participants to take part in facilitative listening. Tell group members that they will be selecting partners. Review the following rules:\n\n1. One person will be speaking and expressing his or her thoughts about the subject at hand.\n2. The second person will not be expressing any thoughts on the subject, but only doing the following things:\n3. Staying neutral no matter how he or she feels about what the other person is saying.\n4. Listening actively by maintaining eye contact and using attentive and open body language.\n5. Asking probing questions after each point made by the other person, to encourage the person to dig deeper.\n6. Paraphrasing what the first person is saying to help him or her clarify his or her thoughts\n7. Summarizing what the other person has said to let the other person know that his or her ideas have been understood.\n\n**Appreciative Review**\n\n\nStep 1: Create a series of questions similar to the ones below:\n\n1. “Looking back over the last few months, what have we accomplished?”\n2. “What has been our greatest achievement? What makes us most proud?”\n3. “What outside factors helped us achieve those successes?”\n4. “What role did each of us play to achieve that?”\n5. “What lessons did we learn during our recent work?”\n6. “What excites us about the opportunities ahead?”\n\n"

        "text": "**Chapter eight - Facilitating Conflict**\n\nAll facilitators need to be attuned to the differences between a debate and an argument. Healthy debate is essential. Dysfunctional arguments, on the other hand, lead to disaster.\n\nHere are the two steps for managing conflict.\n\n1. Step 1: Venting—This involves listening to people so that they feel heard and so that their built-up emotions are diffused. People are rarely ready to move on to solutions until they have had the opportunity to fully vent their feelings.\n2. Step 2: Resolving the issue—When it appears that feelings have been expressed and all differing views have been heard and acknowledged, help members resolve the issues. This involves taking a structured approach to help group members reach solutions. Resolution can come through a collaborative problem-solving activity, helping members create an acceptable compromise, or supporting some members in accommodating or consciously avoiding the topic temporarily to allow time for emotions to further cool.\n\nGeneral principles for good feedback:\n\n1. Be descriptive rather than evaluative\n2. Be specific instead of general\n3. Solicit feedback rather than impose it\n4. Time it\n5. Focus on what can be changed\n6. Check the feedback\n7. Demonstrate caring\n\nExamples of Feedback Statements“Instead of . . . , it would be better if you would. . . .”“I know that you have a lot on your plate but I need. . . .”“When you . . . , I sense that you are/are not. . . .”“I'd like to propose that we try . . . rather than trying to. . . .”\n\nTips for receiving feedback\n\n1. Listen actively\n2. Don't become emotional\n3. Don't be defensive\n4. Accept the input\n5. Work to improve\n\nWording an intervention\n\n1. Statement 1: Describe what you see.\n2. Statement 2: Make an impact statement.\n3. Statement 3: Redirect ineffective behavior(s).\n\n*When someone is being sarcastic: “Ellen, I'm concerned that your ideas aren't being heard because of the tone of voice you're using. Please make your point again, only in a more neutral way.”*"

        "text": "**Chapter Seven - Effective decision making**\n\nHelping groups make high-quality decisions is one of the most important functions of a facilitator. It's also one of the most difficult!\n\nConversations fall into one of the following categories:\n\n* information sharing\n* planning\n* problem solving\n* relationship building\n\nClarifying the Four Empowerment Levels\n\n* Level I—This refers to any decision made by management without input from employees. Employees are informed of the decision and expected to comply.\n* Level II—This is a decision made by management after seeking input from employees. Employees are consulted but have no actual say in the final outcome and are expected to comply. An employee focus group is an example of a \n* Level II decision-making process.Level III—In this category of decision, employees discuss and recommend a course of action, but are unable to act without gaining final approval. Problem-solving workshops are often set up as Level III activities.\n* Level  IV—In this level of decision, the group has been given full authority to make a decision and implement actions plans without having to seek further approvals.\n\nThe Divergence/Convergence ModelRegardless of which decision tool is used, a general pattern that facilitators need to understand is the Divergence/Convergence Model.\n\nThis model provides a warning. If the topic or issue being discussed is extremely broad to begin with, there is a strong likelihood that it will become even broader during the divergence phase.\n\nThe Importance of Building Consensus\n\nThe crucial importance of building consensus simply cannot be overstated and must be fully understood by all facilitators. In fact, facilitation and consensus building are based on the same set of core values and beliefs.\n\nBecause all facilitation activities must strive to be collaborative, participative, synergistic, and unifying, they are essentially consensus building in nature!\n\nIt is also important never to end a consensus exercise by asking whether everyone is happy or everyone agrees with the outcome. Consensus is not about either happiness or total agreement. At the end of even a great consensus process, people have usually made concessions and are usually not getting everything they wanted.\n\n1. Don't ask: “Do we all agree?” or “Is everyone happy?” \n2. Instead ask: “Do we have a well-thought-through outcome that we can all feel committed to implementing and that everyone can live with?”\n\nSymptom 1: Aimless drifting and random discussions.\nSymptom 2: The group uses voting on important items where total buy-in is important, then uses consensus to decide trivia.\nSymptom 3: The group always seems to run out of time just when the important decisions are on the table.\nSymptom 4: When an important item is on the table, people grow heated and argumentative.\nSymptom 5: After a lengthy discussion, it becomes clear that everyone is operating on slightly different assumptions about what the problem is and what the constraints or possibilities are.\nSymptom 6: In spite of the fact that the discussion has been going in circles for some time, no one takes action to get things back on track."

        "text": "*Chapter Six - Creating Participation**\n\nBefore the meeting or workshop, find out:\n\n* ...\n* whether or not members have well-developed group skills such as listening, debating, decision making, and so on\n\nAll facilitators need to understand the basic prerequisites for full participation. \n\nEnsuring that people participate actively is a primary facilitator responsibility. There's no excuse for running a meeting that a few people dominate or in which half the group sits in silent withdrawal.\n\nBooks of icebreakers abound. Do your homework so that you have at least four to six simple warm-up exercises handy at all times.\n\nAt the start of each discussion, take pains to ensure that each topic is clearly defined. For example, if the meeting is being called to solve a problem, ensure that there's a clear problem statement. Regardless of the type of session, a clear statement that describes the purpose of the meeting is a must.\n\nOn the simplest level, getting people to commit is achieved by asking them to answer the universal buy-in question: “What's in it for me?” The most basic buy-in exercise is to pair participants at the start of a session and ask them to spend several minutes discussing two questions in relation to the purpose of the meeting:\n\n* “What's the gain for the organization?”\n* “How will you personally benefit?”\n\nIf you are conducting an intervention with a group of people who are not only extremely dysfunctional, but also unlikely to suggest effective rules for themselves, you will have to suggest the rules. In these types of circumstances, clearly state that you will be unable to facilitate unless these rules are accepted by each member.\n\nThis is a simple but very important technique to improve participation. Facilitators need to make eye contact with everyone, not just the active participants. By looking directly at quiet people, you're telling them that they haven't been forgotten.\n\nSmall tables arranged in a large horseshoe for whole group sessions is a good arrangement for groups with more than twelve members.\n\nSometimes you'll find yourself working with groups whose members behave as though they were being paid bonuses for rudeness. People interrupt. Members run in and out. People dismiss ideas before they've really tried to understand them, and so on.\n\nThe peer feedback format consists of two areas of focus, both of which have a positive intent. The first lets people praise each other. In the second, both people offer supportive advice to help others improve. These areas are:\n\n* “What you do that's really effective. Keep on doing it!”\n* “What you could do that would make you even more effective.”\n\nThis form of peer review is non-threatening, because no one receives negative comments, as both feedback questions are positive and forward-looking."

        "text": "\nGetting to know the people you'll be working with is an essential first step in designing any effective meeting. Before you facilitate, you need to know whether the people coming to the meeting are:\n\n1. Total strangers with nothing in common\n2. Total strangers or only met but who will be working together after this meeting\n3. A group of people who have been working together and get along well\n4. A group of people who are in a state of turmoil\n5. A high-performance team with a solid track record of achievements\n\nExperienced facilitators never take a group or situation for granted! They know that surface appearances may not be accurate. They also know that what they are initially told may not be totally accurate.\n\n*Group assessment*\n\nIn order to design appropriate meeting processes, it's important for you to be aware of the differences between groups and teams, as well as the significant differences between teams at the forming, storming, norming, and performing stages of their development.\n\nA group is a collection of people who come together to communicate, tackle a problem, or coordinate an event. Even though they may meet often, they're a group and not a team because they have specific traits.\n\n* individual members operate under their own separate parameters and work to achieve individual goals\n* groups usually operate by externally set procedures such as the traditional rules of order\n* individuals in groups operate at various levels of empowerment depending on their position in the organization\n* little or no time is devoted to building relationships, and issues of cohesion and trust are rarely addressed\n* leadership and decision-making power typically lie with the leader\n\nSince group members typically pursue their own individual goals, groups tend to exhibit “I”-centered behavior when debating.\n\nIn contrast to a group, a team is a collection of people who come together to achieve a clear and compelling common goal that they have participated in defining. To the members of a true team, that goal is more important than their own individual pursuits. It's this factor that gives a team its cohesion.\n\nWhen team members have differences of opinion, they tend to debate the ideas rather than argue points of view. They aren't out to gain personal victory, but to arrive at the best solution for the good of the whole.\n\nGroup stages\n\n* forming\n* storming\n* norming\n* performing\n\nStorming is a natural stage of team development and not necessarily a sign that a leader is being ineffective. In this stage, members experience a discrepancy between their initial hopes for the team and the realities of working together. Conflict arises and everyone knows that the honeymoon is over. Storming can take place for a variety of reasons, including:\n\nMany people mistakenly think that storming is essentially caused by interpersonal conflict. While conflict is a reliable sign of storming, think of it more as a symptom rather than the cause. In other words, people may be in conflict as a result of problems with the task, lack of process, skill gaps, ineffective leadership, or organizational barriers.\n\nInterpesonal conflict is caused by:\n\n* Problems with the task\n* Lack of process/structure\n* Lack of skills\n* Ineffective leadership\n* Organizational barriers\n\nIn order to survive storming, you need to believe:\n\n* “Storming is okay. It's a normal stage.”\n* “They don't hate each other; they're just storming.”\n* “This is energy I have to channel into solutions.”\n\nSome signs of storming:\n\n* the team isn't achieving its goals\n* people say the team makes them feel drained of energy\n* people no longer think the team is a good idea\n* the team is divided into factions\n* members demonstrate their lack of respect for the leader\n* there's a tendency to complain and second-guess decisions\n\nFacilitating a team in storming:\n\n1. expect and accept tension as normal\n2. stay totally neutral and calm\n3. create an environment in which people can safely express feelings\n4. honestly and openly admit that there's conflict\n5. help members identify issues and solve them together\n6. invite input and feedback\n7. make interventions to correct dysfunctional behaviors\n8. assertively referee heated discussions\n9. train members in group skills\n10. facilitate communication\n\nIn the norming stage, the team confronts its problems and resolves them. New rules or norms are set. When team members adhere to these new norms, the team is able to transcend storming.\n\nDuring norming, members face their issues, accept feedback, and act on it. This results in improved team performance. It is a sad truth that most team leaders do not understand the stages of team development and, thus, are not able to comprehend that when a team storms, this is the cue to help the team engage in norming activities to get through storming to high performing.\n\nPerforming—The Ultimate Team Growth Stage\nIf norming is managed successfully, team members will create new norms and action steps that help them perform more effectively. Once the main blocks and barriers have been removed, members will be ready to focus on their work without distraction. Everyone wins here. Productivity goes up. So does morale.\n\nExcellent facilitation chart.\n\nGroup to team. Provide structure and support\nForming. Build team spirit and comfort while providing lots of structure for activities\nStorming. Listen, address conflict, referee assertively and resolve issues collaboratively\nNorming. Help the group refocus and support team improvements efforts\nPerforming. Build agendas together, share facilitation responsibilities, collaborate, act as support to group.\nAdjourning. To encourage candor, provide safe tools for review and feedback; help members celebrate success\n"

        "text": "**Chapter Four Who Can Facilitate**\n\n“Can a leader, who has an interest in the outcome of a discussion, effectively facilitate the members of his or her own team?”\n\nFirst, leaders have a degree of power over the members of their teams. This means that, even when the leader claims to be neutral, team members may be reluctant to speak up and voice opinions that could be contrary to what they think the leader might want to hear.\nSecond, many leaders have a difficult time switching into the neutral mode. They may want the input of staff, but may be so used to solving problems and making decisions that they can't hold back their opinions.\n\nChallenge 1—Leaders often choose the wrong discussions to facilitate. For example, they may mistakenly try to be neutral during a discussion about a topic on which they have most of the expertise.\n\nChallenge 2—Staff may not understand the role of facilitator and could therefore be confused when the leader starts to act in a new way.\n\nChallenge 3—Group members are going to be justifiably leery of taking part in decision making if they sense that the decision is actually going to be made elsewhere anyway.\n\nAlso, a leader who feels he or she needs to retain the power to make the final decision on a matter can tell people that he or she is using Level II empowerment. In this mode, the leader gathers input from staff, but clearly signals to them that they are not making the final decision. This allows the leader to be both the facilitator in the meeting and the decider after the meeting. The key is to be totally open that this is what is happening.\n\nChallenge 4—The leader sets out to facilitate, but the moment group members propose an idea that seems flawed, he or she falls out of the role and takes control.\n\nChallenge 5—When a leader asks a question, their staff will naturally try to figure out whether there's a motive behind the question or guess what the leader might have in mind.\n\nChallenge 6—People may not want to speak up with the leader in the room or say things that they think the leader won't like.\n\nCenturies of directive leadership have created a culture in many organizations where those at the front line are viewed only as doers and totally underutilized as thinkers. This directive leadership style may still work in some settings, but is largely ineffective in today's knowledge-driven organizations.\n\nOne of the most important outcomes of leaders taking a facilitative approach is that it encourages dialogue. When leaders ask questions, they foster conversation. This gives staff an opportunity to vent, to challenge, and to explore new ideas.\n\nThe first level is the most covert. Simply provide facilitation support from your seat as it's needed. Periodically mention the time, ask quiet people for their ideas, ask probing questions, point out digressions, help people understand differing views, and so forth.\n\nAt the second level, you can speak up and offer the group help when they're struggling. Offer a tool or technique. Wait until they agree that they want your help. Then step in to structure the discussion. At the end of that activity, rejoin the group. The general rule is that if you offer facilitation and members accept, you have been given the role.\n\nAt the third level, approach the leader and ask him or her to allow you to facilitate all or specific portions of an upcoming meeting. If the leader is reluctant, tell him or her that learning to facilitate is one of your personal learning objectives and that practice is essential."

        "text": "**Chapter Three Facilitation Stages**\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes a facilitator can make is to come to a meeting without assessing the needs of the group or preparing design notes for the session.\n\nStages in Conducting a Facilitation\n\n1. Assessment and design\n2. Feedback and refinement\n3. Final preparation\n4. Starting a facilitation\n5. During a facilitation\n6. Ending a facilitation\n7. Following up on a facilitation\n\nThe first step in ensuring success in any facilitation is to make sure the meeting design is based on sufficient and adequate information.\n\nFacilitators also review any data they collected at the start of the facilitation to help everyone understand how the final agenda was created. If you've done a good job of interpreting the input of group members, the design of the meeting should sound as if it flows directly from the information gathered.\n\nOnce you feel confident that you understand the group's needs, you can create a preliminary design. This includes identifying the objectives of the session and writing an agenda with detailed process notes.\n\nOnce you've created a proposed agenda for the session, share the design with group members to gain their approval. Sharing the details about how the process will unfold will help group members understand the structure of the meeting.\n\nProfessional facilitators spend as much time preparing for a facilitation session as they do leading the actual event.\n\nMeetings run best when there are clear rules or norms to follow.\n\nSimply ask members norm-specific questions like: “ What rules will ensure that this meeting runs smoothly?” “What should the rule be about laptops and handhelds?” “What about people coming and going?” “What about side conversations?” “What should the rule be about bringing up topics not on the agenda?”\n\nStrictly speaking, facilitators do not need the approval of group members to intervene. Managing group interaction is, after all, the job of the facilitator. The reason for negotiating the right to assertively intervene is to set group member expectations.\n\nAs the facilitator, you should always be the first person to arrive for any meeting. This ensures that there's time to make last-minute seating changes in the room, post the agenda and survey data, test the equipment, and so on.\n\nOver time you'll develop your own personal approach for beginning a session; here's a checklist to get you started:\n\n* introduce yourself and give a brief personal background\n* clarify the role you'll be playing as the facilitator\n* clarify the roles to be played by any other members\n* go around the room and have members introduce themselves by name and perhaps position, especially if there are people present who don't know each other\n* take care of all housekeeping items\n* conduct a warm-up activity to relax the group; make sure this fits with the time available and activity focus\n* review any data collected from members; have key points posted for all to see and answer questions about the data\n* review the agenda: clarify the objectives and desired outcomes of the entire meeting and also of subsections\n* review the behavioral norms or meeting guidelines that will be in effect during the session\n* remind members of the powers that they have given you to intervene\n* if the group already has a set of meeting guidelines, review these and invite members to add any new norms that may be needed. If the group does not have norms, either help them create a new set of norms for the session or ratify the ones that were developed during the design phase. Post the norms on a wall within clear view of all members\n* set up a parking lot sheet on a side wall to keep track of digressions\n* make a clear statement about the purpose of each agenda item; describe the expected outcome of each agenda item\n* describe the process tools and techniques to be used in each discussion\n* set out the timeframe for each agenda item; in some settings set a timer or appoint a timekeeper\n* start the discussions\n\nDuring all discussions be sure to:\n\n* ensure that all members participate\n* ask probing questions to further the conversation\n* paraphrase continually to acknowledge and clarify ideas\n* monitor time and maintain an appropriate pace\n* keep track of ideas by making concise notes\n* make periodic summaries to restart or end conversations\n* encourage members to adhere to their ground rules\n* make interventions if behaviors become ineffective\n* keep the group on track and park off-topic items\n* help members objectively discuss differences of opinion\n* make periodic process checks to test overall effectiveness\n* stop the action if the discussion spins its wheels and ask members why they are stuck and what will move them forward\n* adjust the process and offer additional tools when needed\n* maintain a high energy level and positive tone\n\nHere are some ways you can help bring effective closure to a meeting:\n\n* provide summary statements about what has been decided and record these on a flip chart or electronic board\n* ensure that each action item is accompanied by detailed action plans\n* round up items not discussed at the meeting, including those placed in the parking lot, and help members create a plan of action for each\n* help the group create an agenda for the next meeting\n* decide on a means of follow-up: written reports/group session\n* clarify your role in any follow-up meetings\n* help members decide who will transcribe notes\n* make digital snapshots of all flip-chart notes as a back-up\n* post an exit survey to get member views about the session\n* hand out a written evaluation so that group members can provide more detailed comments about the session and offer you feedback on your work\n* thank the participants for the opportunity to facilitate\n\nWhen an outside facilitator works with a client, it's routine procedure for him or her to seek feedback about his or her personal performance from the person who made the contract. This is done to ensure that the client is satisfied and helps preserve the client relationship.",

        "text": "**Chapter Two Effective Questioning**\n\nQuestions are the heart and soul of facilitation. They're the main technique for getting the client to open up, reflect, imagine, buy in, identify problems, and discover creative solutions.\n\nPrinciples of effective questioning\n\n* Customize for context\n* Create inviting questions: Avoid embedding too many of your own thoughts and suggestions inside questions.\n* Ask with sensitivity\n* Clarify assumptions\n\nOpen ended questions vs. close ended questions.\n\nHere are some ways to safely ask tough questions:\n\n* Create an anonymous way to gather data. This can be a paper survey that respondents return in a sealed envelope, a reply that they send via email to your office only, or an anonymous reply on an automated survey form.\n* Pose sensitive questions with a 1 to 5 rating scale on a flip chart or whiteboard. Invite people to write their rating on a slip of paper, collect these, and post the ratings. No one will know who gave which scores.\n\n**A lot of interesting examples of questions**\n\nQuestions to Get to Know an Organization.\n\nQuestions to Clarify the Facilitator–Client Relationship\n\nQuestions to Help People Get to Know One Another\n\n* “If you had to condense your resume down to four sentences, what would they be?”\n* “Tell us the three main things/events/talents that got you to where you are today?”\n* “What's the most enjoyable part of your job?”\n* “If you had to name one additional skill or bit of education you'd like to acquire, what would it be?”\n* “What unique gift, experience, or skill do you bring to this organization/project/ team?”\n* “What motivates you to do a great job?”\n* “What traits do you most need to see in a leader? In a fellow team member?”\n\nQuestions to Assess the Current Situation\n\n* “Does the organization have a systematic way of evaluating effectiveness, such as an organized process-improvement program?”\n* “If you had to give me one piece of helpful advice, what would it be?”\n\nQuestions to Establish Project Parameters\n\nQuestions to Establish Behavioral Norms or Rules of Conduct\n\n* “Think back to a time when you worked on a team where everybody got along. What attitudes and behaviors did people exhibit? What rules did they follow?”\n* “List the top five things that motivate you in terms of how you're treated by both leaders and colleagues. Which of these need to become part of how this team operates?”\n\nQuestions to Identify Expectations\n\n* “In your own words answer the question, ‘Why are we here?’ ”\nQuestions to Uncover Issues or Problems\n* “Is there anyone or any group that might benefit from our failure to complete this project?”\n* “How can we improve our capacity to notice issues and deal with them quickly?”\n\nQuestions to Encourage Creative Thinking\n\n* “How would other cultures approach this challenge? What would the Japanese do? The Germans? The Swedes?”\n* “If we set out to delight customers instead of just meet their needs, what would that look like?”\n* “What questions haven't we asked ourselves?”\n* “What would we do if money were no object?”\n\nQuestions to Assess Resistance to Change\n\n* “What are the biggest challenges inherent in our strategy? What stands in our way?”\n* “Is there an aspect of this organization's culture that could factor in blocking change?”\n\nQuestions to Identify Implications\n\nQuestions to Build Ownership and Commitment\n\n* “What will ensure that every single employee gets on board to help make change a reality?”\n\nQuestions to Prompt for Clarity\n\nQuestions to Gain Perspective\n\nQuestions to Challenge and Confront\n\n* “In what way is our current strategy basically what you've always done?”\n* “If there was one human trait that's holding this project back, what would you say it was?”",

        "text": "**Chapter One Understanding Facilitation**\n\nIf you look up the word facilitator in the dictionary, you'll see it described as someone who helps a group of people understand their common objectives and assists them to achieve these objectives without taking a particular position in the discussion.\n\n**Behavioral science identified the need for a leadership style that contributed structure to complex group interactions instead of direction and answers.**\n\n**Facilitation is a leadership role in which the decision-making power resides in the members.** This frees the facilitator to focus on creating a climate of collaboration and provide the group with the structure it needs to be effective.\n\nRather than being a player, facilitators act more like referees. They keep discussion focused and help group members achieve closure.\nThey contribute by\n\n*  conducting background research to understand the needs of the group and what they hope to achieve\n* help the group create rules of conduct that create an effective climate\n* questioning and probing to encourage deeper exploration\n* encouraging participation by everyone\n* helping members constructively manage differences of opinion\n* helping the group to achieve closure and identify next steps\n\nFacilitators bring structure to interactions to make them productive. They plan carefully and then adapt as things unfold.\n\nAll facilitators firmly believe that:\n\n* people are intelligent, capable, and want to do the right thing\n* groups can make better decisions than any one person can make alone\n* everyone's opinion is of equal value, regardless of rank or position\n* people are more committed to the ideas and plans that they have helped to create\n* participants can be trusted to assume accountability for their decisions\n* groups can manage their own conflicts, behaviors, and relationships if they are given the right tools and training\n* the process, if well designed and honestly applied, can be trusted to\n* achieve results\n\nDifference between process and content.\n\n* The content of any meeting is what is being discussed: the task at hand, the subjects being dealt with, and the problems being solved\n* Process deals with how things are being discussed: the methods, procedures, format, and tools used.\n\nIt is important to note that, while facilitators are totally unassertive about the content under discussion, they are very assertive in the way they manage the process elements.\n\nThe core practices, which are rooted in the manner, style, and behavior of the facilitator, include:\n\n* staying neutral\n* listening actively\n* asking questions\n* paraphrasing continuously\n* summarizing discussions\n* recording ideas\n* synthesizing ideas\n* keeping on track\n* testing assumptions\n* managing the climate\n\nThe role of this neutral third party is solely to support group decision making without exerting influence over the outcome.\n\nSay We when you refer to process and You when you refer to content.\n\nThere is a common misconception that taking a neutral stance on the content of meetings means being passive. This is far from the case. In fact, if you operate on the belief that your role is basically unassertive, you'll be in danger of ending up as nothing more than a note taker or scribe, while conflicts rage around you.\n\nA high level of assertiveness on process is especially critical whenever there are personal attacks or other rude behavior. All facilitators are empowered to interrupt and redirect individuals so that their interactions become more appropriate.\n\nA specific style of language has evolved as a part of facilitation. These techniques are especially important when it comes to commenting on people's behavior without sounding critical or judgmental. The main language techniques are:\n\n* paraphrasing. *“Do I understand you correctly that . . . ?”“Are you saying . . . ?”“What I'm hearing you say is . . . .”*\n* reporting behavior. *“I'm noticing that we've only heard from three people throughout most of this discussion.”“I'm noticing that several people are looking through their journals and writing.”*\n* describing feelings. *“I feel we've run out of energy.” (Naming)\n“I feel as if we're facing a brick wall.” (Metaphor)\n“I feel like a fly on the wall.” (Figure of speech)* \n* perception checking. *“You appear upset by the last comment that was made. Are you?”\n“You seem impatient. Are you anxious to move on to the next topic?”* \n\nStart sequences have three components:\n\n* Purpose\n* Process\n* Time\n\nIt's vitally important that facilitators periodically stop the action and conduct what is known as a process check. As with all interventions, the sole purpose of process checking is to restore the effectiveness of the group.\n\nOne of the biggest meeting pitfalls is ending without real closure or detailed next steps. When members leave a meeting without action plans, the entire meeting can feel like a waste of time.\n\n**Best and worst facilitator practices**\n\nFacilitator Behaviors and Strategies\n\n* Be informed\n* Be optimistic\n* Be consensual\n* Be flexible\n* Be understanding\n* Be alert\n* Be firm\n* Be unobtrusive\n\n**Facilitation skill levels**\n\n*Level 1*\nUnderstanding concepts, values, and beliefs; use of facilitative behaviors such as active listening, paraphrasing, questioning, summarizing; managing time; encouraging participation; keeping clear and accurate notes; using basic tools like problem solving and action planning. \n\n*Level 2*\nMastering process tools; designing meetings; skilled at using the right decision-making method, achieving consensus, and getting true closure; handling feedback activities and conducting process checks; using exit surveys; good at managing meetings in an effective manner; helping a group set goals and objectives that are measurable; skilled at checking assumptions and challenging ideas.\n\n*Level 3*\nSkilled at managing conflict and making immediate interventions; dealing with resistance and personal attacks; making design changes on the spot; sizing up a group and use the right strategies for its developmental stage; manage survey feedback exercises; designing and conducting interviews and focus groups; designing and implementing surveys; consolidating ideas from a mass of information into coherent summaries.\n\n*Level 4*\nDesigning and implementing process interventions in response to complex organizational issues; using tools to promote process improvement, customer intimacy, and overall organizational effectiveness; supporting teams in the various stages of team development.\n",

        "text": "**Introduction**\n\nFacilitation is also a central skill for today's managers, who are riding wave after wave of change. New demands are being placed on them. At the same time, the old command and control model of supervision, which worked for decades, is no longer as effective.\n\nTo keep pace, today's leaders need to be coaches, mentors, and teachers. At the core of each of these new roles is the skill of facilitation.\n\nFacilitator: One who contributes structure and process to interactions so groups are able to function effectively and make high-quality decisions. A helper and enabler whose goal is to support others as they pursue their objectives."

        "text": "**Conclusion**\n\nI have collected ideas from many sources and offered them as concrete practices. But copying games and exercises is not enough to change organizations. You must adapt practices to your needs and keep in mind the principles of engaging people, improving the system, and delighting all clients.\n\nIn any case, what I hope I have achieved with the chapters I did write is that you believe, as I do, that everyone is responsible for management. You shouldn't wait for full-time managers to innovate the way you organize your work. Good management practices are about engaging the workers, improving the system, and delighting the stakeholders. Anyone can do that. Anyone can manage for more happiness in the workplace.\n\n**The Idea Farmer**\n\nAlmost everything in this book emerged because I read a lot of books, blogs, websites, and magazines. (And I travel a lot.) I read because I love collecting other people's good ideas. As I often say, “steal and tweak” is the best recipe for innovation. Everything I say is stolen and tweaked, even the concept of “steal and tweak” itself.\n\nNever forget that better principles, not better practices, are what organizations really need.\n\nSay that a cook uses a recipe found online, decides to follow it to the letter, and the apple pie doesn't come out as expected. Did the recipe “fail”? What if the cook says, “Apple pies don't work around here. We tried. Nobody liked them.” “The recipe doesn't work” is shorthand for “I haven't yet worked out how to adapt the instructions to local circumstances and make a version of the recipe that works.”\n\nConvincing managers of the benefits of new ideas is best done by delivering on commitment in order to create trust, always trying to solve your manager's problem first, and experimenting with new ideas in safe-to-fail environments.\n\nTrying to copy or reproduce another company's tools, techniques, or principles does little to change an organization's culture, its way of doing things. For example, how do you get people to actually live principles? On the other hand, focusing on developing daily behavior patterns is a leverage point because, as the field of psychology shows us, with practice, behavior patterns are changeable, learnable, and reproducible.\n\nKnowing that it is all about how the entire system acts on individuals, and how individuals act on the entire system, has made me more confident and systematic as a project manager and as a change manager."

        "text": "**Chapter 12: Yay! Questions and Celebration Grids: Learn from Successes and Failures**\n\nDoes your organization appreciate the things you've learned? Do you applaud colleagues who do their jobs well? All too often, organizations live day by day, from one crisis to another, and they forget to take note of the good things that happened. By asking two important questions and drawing a celebration grid, you can look for things to treasure.\n\nInformation theorists have discovered that systems learn most when failure rates are around 50 percent. In other words, when your experiments have a good chance of succeeding and a good chance of failing, they generate the most information for you to learn from.\n\nA learning organization should not aim to minimize the amount of failure. Reducing failure would reduce learning. Of course, maximizing failure also makes no sense. What we should maximize is the understanding of our problems. This understanding happens by experiencing both successes and failures. There is an optimal learning rate when you think “wow, I'm brilliant!” and “my God, I'm such an idiot!” roughly in equal measure. Therefore, we should celebrate learning, not successes or failures.\n\nWe should celebrate good practices, not punish mistakes.\n\nAs a great management exercise, you can help people to focus on the proper areas in the celebration grid by asking them these two “yay!” questions: What did we do well (by following practices)?What did we learn (by running experiments)?"

        "text": "**Chapter 11: Happiness Door: Aim for a Happier Organization**\n\nResearch tells us that happiness is more a decision than a destination. And it is something you can simply decide to achieve in the workplace as well.\n\nBy the same token, a satisfied worker is not necessarily an engaged worker. Satisfied workers feel content in their work environment because it satisfies all or most of their needs. But when the person is not engaged and productive for the organization, we should be wary of the problem of slacking off: being not very productive and focusing only on one's own needs.\n\nOne interesting side effect of the happiness door practice is that it is reflexive. The information radiator not only collects people's feedback but also influences it. People can see what others are doing before them, therefore they will be influencing each other.\n\nThe happiness door is meant to improve happiness. Many people appreciate a social event even more when the approach to feedback is open, transparent, and engaging. The fact that there is a happiness door in the room means people are less likely to put anything near the bottom of the door!\n"

This will motivate people who see their own values reflected in the organization's values.\n* Acceptance - As a manager, you can do more than just be respectful toward minorities. You can ensure that people get hired because they add distinctive qualities to the social system. You can ensure that teams are organized in such a way that diversity in all forms is not merely tolerated as being acceptable, but embraced as being crucial.\n* Mastery - As a manager, you should make sure that repetitive and boring tasks are stripped from your business model and either automated or handed over to another business where people know how to thrive on that kind of work.\n* Power - It is no coincidence that the word power is encapsulated in the word empowerment. As a manager, you can set up the environment in such a way that people feel empowered to take responsibility and become leaders and change agents, without having to ask someone's permission.\n* Freedom - People must feel free in the self-organizing teams in which they are working. When some team members insist that all decisions are made collaboratively and that rules are necessary to keep order in the team, those who are motivated by freedom may feel that their environment is suffocating them.\n* Relatedness\n* Order\n* Goal - Motivate your employees by clarifying what the company stands for and what it tries to achieve in the world. People appreciate recognizing that their personal goals are reflected in the work they do.\n* Status - As a manager, you can nurture people's need for status by offering them opportunities to make progress in the directions that matter to them.\n\nWhat about your workers? Are they looking forward to the next workday? If not, what's preventing them from feeling intrinsically motivated?"

Regrettably, most compensation systems are considered unfair by employees and unscientific by experts. That's why it would be wise to consider some lesser-known alternatives that are based on real merits instead of imagined performance.\n\nSome people argue that organizations should get rid of their bonus systems entirely. They say most of an organization's performance is in the system, not in the people, and therefore it's best not to differentiate between employees.\n\nA hugs based system when everybody is distributing hugs and people can cash in everytime 6 is shown by a dice."

        "text": "**Chapter 8: Metrics Ecosystem and Scoreboard Index: Measure Performance the Right Way**\n\nThe way people measure performance in organizations is often just plain wrong. Everyone should learn the 12 rules of good metrics. This would help establish a culture in which people see measurement as a way to learn and improve, and create an organization where all workers participate in the metrics ecosystem.\n\nMeasurement can be easy, fun, and motivating, and it's one of the most important activities for any organization. What gets measured gets managed, and what gets managed gets done.\n\n**Jumping to conclusions with incomplete information, and not understanding that there's a gap between what is measurable and what is desirable, is one of the biggest problems with humans.**\n\nPeter Drucker offered his management by objectives (MBO) method for exactly this purpose: to help managers define the purpose of their organization, set targets for their own work, and measure progress toward their goal. There's nothing wrong with targets, as long as you don't bother anyone else with them. Drucker specifically said that if managers continuously fail to fulfill their own commitments and never reach their objectives, they should make room for others.\n\nProfessional organizations, such as Toyota, don't use measurements as a way for managers to judge the performance of their workers. The metrics are available for people's self-improvement rather than for managerial coercion and control. At Google it's the same; all workers only set objectives and key results for themselves.\n\nGoogle does not use people's objectives and targets as input for promotions.\n\n* Rule 1: Measure for a purpose. You must always understand why you are measuring. The metric is not a goal in itself. Never forget that it's just a means to an end. It all starts with why.\n* Rule 2: Shrink the unknown. A metric is just a surrogate for what you really want to know. Don't jump to conclusions. Always try to reduce the size of what is still unknown.\n* Rule 3: Seek to improve. Don't only measure things that will make you look good. There is plenty of data around, but you must focus on what enables you to do better work.\n* Rule 4: Delight all stakeholders. Your work depends on others, and others depend on you. Never optimize for just one stakeholder. Instead, measure your work from multiple perspectives.\n* Rule 5: Distrust all numbers. Observers usually influence their own metrics, and they suffer from all kinds of biases. Have a healthy, skeptical attitude toward any reported numbers.\n* Rule 6: Set imprecise targets. When people have targets, they have an inclination to focus on the targets instead of the real purpose. Avoid this tendency by keeping your targets vague.\n* Rule 7: Own your metrics. Everyone is responsible for their own work, and metrics help us improve that work. Therefore, everyone should be responsible for their own metrics.\n* Rule 8: Don't connect metrics to rewards. Rewards often kill intrinsic motivation and lead to dysfunctional behaviors in organizations. Don't incentivize people to do work they should like doing.\n* Rule 9: Promote values and transparency. Human beings are smart and able to game any system. To prevent gaming, be transparent about values, intentions, and the metrics everyone is using.\n* Rule 10: Visualize and humanize. Numbers tend to dehumanize everything. Replace digits with colors and pictures, and keep the measurements close to where the actual work is done.\n* Rule 11: Measure early and often. Most people don't measure often enough. Measure sooner and faster to prevent risks and problems from growing too big for you to handle.\n* Rule 12: Try something else. It's rarely a good idea to do the same things over and over. The environment changes all the time. The same should apply to how and what you measure."

        "text": "**Chapter 7: Feedback Wraps and Unlimited Vacation: Learn How to Offer Constructive Feedback**\n\nFor this reason, companies such as The Motley Fool, Netflix, HubSpot, Evernote, and Zynga have stopped defining how many hours per day people should work and how many days in the year they can go on a vacation.10 The benefits of such an unlimited vacation policy  are similar to the ones I mentioned earlier: better morale, increased productivity, higher retention, and higher engagement.11 And no tiresome discussions about banking vacation days, half days, bonus days, and other nonsense.\n\nFew topics are as widely misunderstood as trust. Everyone talks about it, but when I ask for clarification, nobody can properly define it. They all claim employees have a right to be trusted, but few are willing to trust a coworker to successfully perform open-heart surgery, build a rocket, or win the Olympics.\n\nThe model of trust that I trust most lists 10 factors that all contribute to the presence (or lack) of trust.\n\n* Risk Tolerance - Some people are risk takers, others are cautious.\n* Adjustment - Some people are optimists, others are pessimists.\n* Power - Some people have authority, others suffer from it.\n* Security - Sometimes the stakes are high, sometimes they're low.\n* Similarities - Some people are similar to each other, others aren't.\n* Interests - Sometimes interests are aligned, sometimes they aren't.\n* Benevolent Concern - Some are nice to us, others . . . not so much.\n* Capability - Some know what they're doing, others . . . not really.\n* Integrity - Some people deliver on commitment, others . . . forget it.\n* Communication - Some can communicate well, some . . . —uhm.\n\nYou should start with the premise that trust (maybe not in your interests, similarities, or benevolent concerns, but in your capabilities, integrity, and communication) needs to be established first before you can do whatever you want.\n\nThey should learn that trust is grown by delivering on commitments, communicating often and well, aligning interests, showing benevolent concern, and so on. When trust is established first, it is much easier to discuss and evaluate results later.\n\nSecond only to firing employees,managers hate performance appraisals the most.\n\nI believe the first thing we must learn is how to offer written feedback to our colleagues in an easy, honest, and friendly way. I would like to emphasize friendly because research shows that a “treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen” approach undermines morale and motivation in organizations, which destroys collaboration between employees as well as their performance.\n\n1on1 on a Non-Violent Communication like Framework:\n\n1. describe the context\n2. list the observations\n3. express your emotions\n4. end with suggestions\n\n**Assume that everyone wants to do well. If people don't perform well, the fault should be found in the system around people that is preventing them from doing a great job. Therefore, any evaluations of performance should reveal systemic problems, not personal failure. Your suggestions for improvement should reflect that mindset.**"

After all, you won't have a first mover advantage for long if somebody else has the fast learner advantage.\n\nIn modern organizations, more and more people are expected to be self-organizing. Sadly, I have noticed that self-organizing teams are not always self-developing and self-educating teams.\n\n**We cannot educate employees. They can only educate themselves.**\n\nDevelopment is always self-development. For the enterprise to assume responsibility for the development of a person is idle boast. The responsibility rests with the individual, her abilities, her efforts.\n\nThe job of management is not to select the best ideas;it is to create a great system that allows for the best ideas to emerge.\n\nThe purpose of training is to reduce variety, to get a group of people tackling tasks in the same way; so training reduces variety. The purpose of learning is the exact opposite. Learning increases the individual's capacity to respond to different situations; it increases variety.\n\nOrganize exploration days / shipit days / hackathons, etc. with the team."

They are important. Without respect for existing value, the creation of new value easily melts down into selfishness.\n\nResearch confirms that clarity of values and direction makes a significant difference in behavior at work and is a force behind motivation, commitment, and productivity. Many employees in the world are in need of these clearer boundaries, because most of them suffer from cognitive overload: too many choices and too little direction.\n\nRather than viewing organizational processes as ways of extracting more economic value, great companies create frameworks that use societal value and human values as decision-making criteria.\n\nObviously, such handbooks and culture books only work when employees actually use them and know what they say. All too often, employee handbooks are created by human resources departments, not by employees themselves, and are devoid of any emotion. Values are offered as bullet points and accompanied by rules, policies, and legal disclaimers. It's no wonder that, with such handbooks buried deep down in file systems, employees usually have no affinity with any core or wish values of the company. The real culture communicated in cases like these is “culture is defined by managers” and “we're not supposed to have fun.”\n\nAt the end of the day, you just ask yourself, “How did our vision and values influence decisions I made today?” If they did not, then they are pretty much BS."

        "text": "**Chapter 3: Delegation Boards and Delegation Poker - Empower Workers with Clear Boundaries**\n\nBut people behave according to how they are treated. When the boss always corrects everything you deliver, why bother producing a polished result? It'll all get changed anyway! Thus, the quality of the work goes down, and the boss has to tighten control even more. An intrusive management style generates continuous confirmation that the boss's worldview is correct.\n\nComplex systems survive and thrive because control is distributed. It is why the Internet cannot be destroyed. It is why terrorist groups form independent, self-organizing units. And it is why organizations require workers to have a high level of control over their own work. A top-down style of management is undesirable because it stifles an organization's ability to deal with complexity.\n\nReinertsen suggests creating a list of key decision areas to address the problem of not setting boundaries. The list can include things like working hours, key technologies, product design, and team membership. A manager should make it perfectly clear what the team's authority level is for each key decision area in this list.\n\nThe seven levels of delegation should not be applied to individual tasks and deliverables. Instead, they should be applied to key decision areas.\n\n“I coached a team that was formed with the ‘instruction' to be self-organized. But the team was new to this and had only experience with a more command-and-control mindset. They were left to their own devices with no advice on how to ‘self-organize.' The result was team conflict, low effectiveness, and decision paralysis, and the manager got more and more irritated about being asked to help them out all the time. Traditional micromanagement was the inevitable result.I helped the team to list their key decision areas, and we used the delegation poker game to facilitate discussions and agree upon delegation levels. The result was their first delegation board."

        "text": "**Chapter 1: Kudo Box and Kudo Cards - Motivate People with Better Rewards**\n\nThere are many wrong ways to reward employees. A simple but effective approach is to install a kudo box, which enables people to give each other a small reward. The kudo box fulfills the six rules for rewards and works much better than bonuses and other forms of financial motivation.\n\nAnd bonus systems are still implemented all around the world “to incentivize performance,” despite the fact that experts have known for decades that there's no proven correlation between bonuses and performance.\n\nExtrinsic motivation is defined as behavior that is driven by external rewards (given by others), such as money, grades, and praise. Rewards are among the trickiest and least understood tools in management. When applied in the right way they can generate significant results.\n\nIt is called the overjustification effect. Instead of expecting and feeling enjoyment, people expect a reward.\n\n1. Don't promise rewards in advance.\n2. Keep anticipated rewards small.\n3. Reward continuously, not once.\n4. Reward publicly, not privately.\n5. Reward behavior, not outcome.\n6. Reward peers, not subordinates.\n\nBut no matter what you call it, a public system that enables people to give each other small, unexpected tokens of appreciation for doing a good job meets all six basic principles of good rewards. A gift attached to the compliment is of course optional. It is the intention that counts. However, experience suggests that a tangible gift helps a compliment to have a bigger impact on the receiver.\n\nWhat if you see such risks of abusing the system because you have a low level of trust in others? What if this low level of trust is a result of your company's culture? What if the kudo box is exactly the kind of practice that is needed to change this culture of distrust in a relatively harmless way?\n\nFinally, some readers have asked me, “Shouldn't we reward teams instead of individuals? Don't we want people to work collaboratively, instead of going at it alone?” Well, yes, of course. But teamwork can only emerge as an outcome of people's individual contributions to that team. You could give a reward because of what an individual did for the whole team. Obviously, sometimes it could be worth praising a whole team, a whole department, or even a whole organization. Quite often, however, people's individual contributions to the whole have to be recognized first, before the whole unit performs in a way that deserves praise as well."

        "text": "**Introduction: What is Management 3.0**\n\nWhen an organization's culture is bad, don't just blame the managers. Happiness in an organization is everyone's responsibility. Better management means engaging people, improving the whole system, and increasing value for clients.\n\nA creative worker is a person who creates or grows unique value within a network of people, or someone who creates or grows the network in an original way for others to share their value. Even better, it can be a person who does both! The term knowledge worker, on the other hand, implies that people add value only with their knowledge. It does not imply creativity or the ability to network.\n\nThese are the questions I encountered most often:\n\n* How can we motivate our workers?\n* How can we change the organization's culture?\n* How can we change the mindset of managers?\n* How can we get teams to take responsibility?\n* How can we improve teamwork and collaboration?\n* How can we get managers to trust their teams?\n* How can we develop people's competencies?\n* How can we be agile when the organization is not?\n\n**When people don't focus on improving themselves, is it any wonder they're always complaining about each other? I often ask audiences if they have heard about global movements, improvement methods, or innovative management practices, and usually only a few hands go up. But when I ask them if their organization's culture needs to change, almost everyone says yes! It seems that few people learn, but most find fault in how their colleagues work.**\n\nThe happiness of managers and other workers is crucial because happy people are more productive. I firmly believe we can only improve worker happiness when everyone feels responsible for management and learns to manage the system instead of managing each other.\n\nFor organizations, common practice is that *people are managed like machines*, with their workers treated as gears and levers. I call this **Management 1.0**. In this style of management, people assume the organization consists of parts and that improvement of the whole requires monitoring, repairing, and replacing those parts. We can find Management 1.0 everywhere around us.\n\nFortunately, some people have learned to do better. In a **Management 2.0** organization, everyone recognizes that *“people are the most valuable assets”* and that managers have to become *“servant leaders”* while steering the organization from “good to great.” These are certainly interesting ideas, but sadly, managers often use the wrong approach. *They correctly understand that improvement of the whole organization is not achieved by merely improving the parts but, at the same time, they prefer to stick to the hierarchy and have a tendency to forget that human beings don't respond well to top-down control and mandated “improvements.”*\n\nTrust breaks down completely because managers are allowed to know more about employees than employees are allowed to know about each other, which emphasizes that managers are more important than nonmanagers.\n\n**The only effect consistently achieved across all ideas implemented by bosses is that they reinforce the position of the boss.**\n\nIf a system is to be stable, the number of states of its control mechanism must be greater than or equal to the number of states in the system being controlled.\n\nThe study of complexity science investigates how relationships between parts of a complex system (such as an ecosystem or an economy) give rise to the collective behaviors of that system, and how the whole system in turn influences the parts. The term systems thinking represents the process of understanding how human systems (including people, teams, and organizations) behave, interact with their environment, and influence each other. A complexity thinker applies both: insights from scientific research into complex systems and understanding of the workings of social systems.\n\nThat idea makes sense, but there's a caveat. When I am the manager of a group of people, I can never have more complexity than this complex system of human beings (which includes all their complex interactions). It's just impossible!\n\nIn the last decade or two, we have witnessed the emergence of a good number of big ideas, including agile, lean, scrum, kanban, beyond budgeting, lean startup, delivering happiness, design thinking, real options, scenario planning, conscious capitalism, and many more. What all these manifestos, methods, and movements have in common is that they promote better ways of working while borrowing a thing or two from science.  I often say they're like a family. They all share the same DNA, which they received from their parents: systems thinking and complexity theory.\n\nMy core belief for management is that organizations are complex, adaptive systems and that good management means taking care of the system instead of manipulating people. I believe that improving the environment so that it keeps workers engaged and happy is one of the main responsibilities of management; otherwise the organization fails to generate value.\n\nIn other words, a management practice is a good practice when:\n\n1. it engages people and their interactions;\n2. it enables them to improve the system;\n3. it helps to delight all clients.\n\nCreative workers choose to boss themselves."

Here’s why: \n\n1. Vulnerability reveals reality.\n2. Vulnerability fosters trust.\n3. Vulnerability invites growth.\n4. Vulnerability builds confidence.\n5. Vulnerability heals wounds.\n6. Vulnerability creates bonds.\n7. Vulnerability deepens love.\n8. Vulnerability makes us more attractive.\n9. Vulnerability teaches us comfort with uncertainty.\n\n“The real catastrophe is to come to the end of your life only to realize that by playing it safe and trying to avoid risk, you took the biggest risk of all, and lost the most valuable thing that you could lose: a life that was rich with meaning, feeling, and joy, one that not only filled your own cup to the brim, but spilled over to fill the cups of others who were moved and inspired by you.”\n\n"

        "text": "**Becoming a leader**\n\nAs animals made for cooperation with a need to trust, too many of us are working in environments that bring out the worst in us. We have become cynical, paranoid, selfish and open to addiction. Our health and, worse, our humanity, are at risk. But we cannot hide behind excuses. We can’t blame the media, the Internet or “the system.” We can’t blame “the corporations” or Wall Street or even government anymore. We are not victims of our situation. We are the architects of it.\n\nWe admit that a good too many of our organizational cultures have a systemic addiction to performance and making the numbers. An addiction, like all addictions, that offers fleeting highs and often comes at significant cost to our health and our relationships. Further complicating our addiction is our ability to raise our status with celebrity or wealth alone, ignoring the anthropological requirements of alpha status. But admitting we have an addiction is only step one.\n\nStep Twelve is the commitment to help another alcoholic beat the disease. Step Twelve is all about service. And it is service that is the key to breaking our dopamine addictions in our organizations too.\n\nThe whole purpose of AA meetings is to make people feel safe. The people who share the struggle, who come together to help and be helped, are warm and friendly and welcoming. For many alcoholics, the connections last well after the meetings are over. As Jon told me, the connections he made helped him feel less alone and the stories he heard gave him hope.\n\nThis is how serotonin is supposed to work. It doesn’t just raise our status, it reinforces caring, mentoring relationships.\n\nAnd then there is oxytocin. Those feelings of trust and love, all those warm and fuzzies, as it turns out, are critical to helping us beat addiction.\n\nOxytocin is so powerful that the bonds of trust and love we form not only help us beat or ward off addiction, they actually help us live longer.\n\nWhenever there is a human bond involved— a real, true, honest human bond, where neither party wants anything from the other— we seem to find the strength to endure— and the strength to help. We can put up with a great many hardships when we have a partner to help see us through. In fact, it not only makes the hardships feel easier to endure, but it actually helps us manage the stress and the anxiety.\n\nIf the leaders of organizations give their people something to believe in, if they offer their people a challenge that outsizes their resources but not their intellect, the people will give everything they’ve got to solve the problem. And in the process, not only will they invent and advance the company, they may even change an industry or the world in the process (just as an early version of Microsoft did). But if the resources are vastly greater than the problem before us, then the abundance works against us.\n\nEmpathy is not something we offer to our customers or our employees from nine to five. Empathy is, as Johnny Bravo explains, “a second by second, minute by minute service that [we] owe to everyone if [we] want to call [ourselves] a leader.”\n\nEverything about being a leader is like being a parent. It is about committing to the well-being of those in our care and having a willingness to make sacrifices to see their interests advanced so that they may carry our banner long after we are gone."

        "text": "**A society of addicts**\n\nAt the Center of All Our Problems Is Us.\n\nAll managers of metrics have an opportunity to become leaders of people.\n\nBingeing, gambling, drinking and smoking are all, ostensibly, dopamine addictions.\n\nBorn in the early 1980s through the early 2000s, members of Gen Y are also referred to as Millennials because they were the first generation to come of age in the twenty-first century.\n\nMany employers complain that their Millennial employees, for example, are poor communicators, lack the instinct to be proactive, cannot handle critical feedback, are impatient, are unable to commit, and the big one: have a sense of entitlement.\n\nEvery parent grapples with this critical decision— whether to swoop in to help their kids or to let them struggle, fall or fail. One communicates love and support; the other teaches self-reliance and grit. Both are important, but a growing body of evidence suggests that the parents of the Millennial Generation may have erred on the side of over-coddling their kids and accidentally tipped the delicate balance between the two.\n\nRewards for basic participation have other adverse effects as well. They not only deny children the chance to learn important lessons about adversity, loss and resilience, but they can also encourage complacency and overconfidence.\n\nMany Millennials think that because they grew up with all these technologies they are better at multitasking, and they often use multiple devices at the same time. In the Frontline episode “Digital Nation,” college students talk about multitasking in both social life and the classroom.\n\nIn studies of workplace behavior, University of California Irvine researchers found similar results. When a worker is interrupted, it takes them around twenty-three minutes to return to their original task. Now consider that the average worker is interrupted about every three minutes.\n\nThe evidence is indisputable. Despite what they or anyone else believes, with rare exceptions, those who think they are more productive because they are better at multitasking are just wrong. What they are better at is being distracted.\n\nAs a generation, Millennials tend to be socially conscious. They care about the world around them, and they want to make an impact, both personally and professionally. According to the 2015 annual Deloitte Millennial Survey, 90 percent of Millennials, globally, want to use their skills for good, and six in ten report a “sense of purpose” as the reason they chose to work for their current employer. I love this about Millennials. I wish more of us cared as much as they do. The issue isn’t the goal, it’s the expectations they have about the time it takes to achieve that goal.\n\nI will concede that impatience is perhaps only part of the reason so many Millennials quit their jobs so quickly. The other part is that too many companies don’t have a clear sense of purpose, cause or belief to offer them. Too many company mission and vision statements talk about being the best, the biggest or the most respected— all goals that are self-centered and offer zero contribution to the world. How are Millennials ever to live their Why if the companies that court them don’t have a sense of Why themselves?\n\n**You may have noticed a recurring theme throughout this book and this chapter— the importance of relationships not only to our survival, but also to our sense of fulfillment. This is no less true for human beings working in the modern workplace than it was for human beings living in tribes fifty thousand years ago.**\n\nBut such relationships rarely go beyond the superficial. There is no getting away from the truth: there is simply nothing that can replace real, face-to-face human interaction. Perhaps this is the reason one Millennial I spoke with admitted that he “struggles to form deep, meaningful friendships.”\n\nWhen we are immersed in a Facebook-Instagram-Snapchat world, where everyone’s lives are on display, it’s hard not to compare ourselves to others. And it’s easy to become envious and doubt the quality of our own lives when our friends’ posts come off like a highlight reel of the year’s best movies.\n\nMillennials have become well practiced at curating their lives. They know better than anyone how to manage their personal brands and present themselves as they want to be seen … not necessarily as they are.\n\nThe Millennials who are entering or are already in the workforce require employers who are empathetic, understand the challenges that this generation faces, create Circles of Safety and find ways to make the most of the many positive attributes and unique skills that Millennials bring to the table. And for the Millennials themselves, it means taking personal accountability, being willing to turn off their phones or disconnect from social media from time to time to engage in the kind of face-to-face human interaction that leads to real connection and meaningful relationships. Only then will they find the fulfillment they are looking for. We must stop blaming each other and start helping each other."

        "text": "**Destructive abundance**\n\n**Leadership Lesson 1: So Goes the Culture, So Goes the Company**\n\n**Leadership Lesson 2: So Goes the Leader, So Goes the Culture**\n\nCaptain Marquet came to understand that the role of the leader is not to bark commands and be completely accountable for the success or failure of the mission. It is a leader’s job instead to take responsibility for the success of each member of his crew. It is the leader’s job to ensure that they are well trained and feel confident to perform their duties. To give them responsibility and hold them accountable to advance the mission. If the captain provides direction and protection, the crew will do what needs to be done to advance the mission.\n\n“I can’t delegate my legal responsibilities, I can’t delegate my relationships and I can’t delegate my knowledge. Everything else, however, I can ask others to take responsibility for,”\n\nIn an organization with a strong Circle of Safety, not only is the leader willing to share knowledge, but so too is everyone else. Again, the leader sets the tone.\n\nInside the Circle, mistakes are not something to be feared. In organizations in which there is no safety provided, people are more likely to hide mistakes or problems out of self-preservation. The issue is, those mistakes and problems, if not addressed, often add up and appear later when they become too big to contain.\n\n“The goal of a leader is to give no orders,” Captain Marquet explains. “Leaders are to provide direction and intent and allow others to figure out what to do and how to get there.” And this is the challenge most organizations face. “We train people to comply, not to think,” Captain Marquet goes on. If people only comply, we can’t expect people to take responsibility for their actions. The chain of command is for orders, not information. Responsibility is not doing as we are told, that’s obedience. Responsibility is doing what is right.\n\n**In physics, the definition of power is the transfer of energy. We measure the power of a lightbulb in watts. The higher the wattage, the more electricity is transferred into light and heat and the more powerful the bulb. Organizations and their leaders operate exactly the same way. The more energy is transferred from the top of the organization to those who are actually doing the job, those who know more about what’s going on on a daily basis, the more powerful the organization and the more powerful the leader.**\n\n**Leadership Lesson 3: Integrity Matters**\n\nLeadership, the Marines understand, is not about being right all the time. Leadership is not a rank worn on a collar. It is a responsibility that hinges almost entirely on character. Leadership is about integrity, honesty and accountability. All components of trust. Leadership comes from telling us not what we want to hear, but rather what we need to hear. To be a true leader, to engender deep trust and loyalty, starts with telling the truth.\n\nThe integrity of those in our community is, as our brain perceives it, a matter of life and death.\n\nThe most common display of a lack of integrity in the business world is when a leader of an organization says what others want to hear and not the truth.\n\nAs the Zen Buddhist saying goes, how you do anything is how you do everything.\n\n**Leadership Lesson 4: Friends Matter**\n\nAll leaders, in order to truly lead, need to walk the halls and spend time with the people they serve, “eyeball leadership,” as the Marines call it.\n\n**Leadership Lesson 5: Lead the People, Not the Numbers**\n\n“Teams led by a directive leader initially outperform those led by an empowering leader. However, despite lower early performance, teams led by an empowering leader experience higher performance improvement over time because of higher levels of team-learning, coordination, empowerment and mental model development.” In other words, all of the benefits of higher performing teams are direct results of feeling safe among their own and believing that their leaders have their well-being at heart. Any other model is simply a gamble that the next genius will be as good as the one who left irrespective of how strong the rest of the company could be.\n\nEven Welch himself would eventually call the focus on shareholder value the “dumbest idea in the world,” insisting to this day that he always saw shareholder value as an outcome, not a strategy.\n\nGood leadership is like exercise. We do not see any improvement to our bodies with day-to-day comparisons. In fact, if we only compare the way our bodies look on a given day to how they looked the previous day, we would think our efforts had been wasted. It’s only when we compare pictures of ourselves over a period of weeks or months that we can see a stark difference. The impact of leadership is also best judged over time."

        "text": "**The abstract challenge**\n\nMilgram’s experiment is being carried out every single day in offices across the country and around the world.\n\nThe bigger our companies get, the more physical distance is created between us and the people who work for us or buy our products. At such scale, we can no longer just walk into the aisles and count the cans of soup on the shelf either.\n\nWhen we divorce ourselves from humanity through numerical abstraction, we are, like Milgram’s volunteers, capable of inhuman behavior. Just like the conditions Milgram set in his experiment, the physical separation between us and those on the receiving end of our decisions can have a dramatic impact on lives … the lives of people who cannot be seen or heard. The more abstract people become, the more capable we are of doing them harm.\n\nWhen big numbers start representing human beings, as Stalin told us, our ability to empathize starts to falter. If your sister, the major breadwinner in her family, loses her job, it will have a significant impact on the lives of your niece and nephew. And that loss would be a deep emotional burden on your sister, her family and probably you too. But a decision made using a spreadsheet to lay off four thousand people at some large corporation loses tangibility and becomes something that just needs to be done to meet certain goals. The numbers no longer represent people who support their families but simply abstractions to be calculated.\n\n**Rule 1. Keep It Real— Bring People Together**\n\nAnd just as money can’t buy love, the Internet can’t buy deep, trusting relationships. What makes a statement like that somewhat tricky or controversial is that the relationships we form online feel real.\n\nReal, live human interaction is how we feel a part of something, develop trust and have the capacity to feel for others. It is how we innovate. It is why telecommuters never really feel like they are a part of the team as strongly as the ones who go to work every day.\n\n**Rule 2. Keep It Manageable— Obey Dunbar’s Number**\n\nAfter doing some counting, Gore concluded that to maintain the sense of camaraderie and teamwork he felt was essential for the factory to run smoothly, it should have only about 150 people. That was the magic number.\n\nProfessor Dunbar figured out that people simply cannot maintain more than about 150 close relationships. “Putting it another way,” he likes to say, “it’s the number of people you would not feel embarrassed about joining uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar.”\n\n**Rule 3. Meet the People You Help**\n\n**Rule 4. Give Them Time, Not Just Money**\n\n**Rule 5. Be Patient— The Rule of Seven Days and Seven Years**\n\nThe fact is, we instinctively know that the strong bond of human trust cannot be formed after one date or even after one week. In contrast, if I told you I’ve been dating the same woman for seven years and we’re not married yet, you might think, “What’s wrong then?”\n\nThe strong positive feeling we may have after a great first date, or even a great job interview, is not love or trust. It’s a predominantly dopamine-fueled feeling telling us that we think we’ve found what we’re looking for. Because it feels good, we can sometimes mislabel it as something more stable than it is, even if both parties feel it.\n\nOur world is one of impatience. A world of instant gratification. A world ruled by dopamine. Google can give us the answer we want now. We can buy online and get what we want now. We can send and receive information instantaneously. We don’t have to wait a week to see our favorite show, we can watch it now.\n\n“Destructive Abundance” is what I call the result of this imbalance. It is what happens when selfish pursuits are out of balance with selfless pursuits.\n\nWhen protecting the results is prioritized above protecting those who produce the results."

        "text": "**How we got here**\n\nEvery generation seems to confound or rebel against the generation before it. Each new generation embodies a set of values and beliefs molded by the events, experiences and technologies of their youth … which tend to be a little different from those of their parents.\n\nThe Boomers witnessed events that only reinforced their early beliefs that “government can’t be trusted,” “we have to look out for ourselves” and “we need to change the way things are done.” Forget the status quo— the Boomers aspired to self-realization.\n\nThis is a story about the long-term repercussions when a leader sets a new tone about what is acceptable or unacceptable behavior inside an organization.\n\nPut simply, the more pressure the leaders of a public company feel to meet the expectations of an outside constituency, the more likely they are to reduce their capacity for better products and services.\n\nA new set of values and norms has been established for our businesses and our society— a system of dopamine-driven performance that rewards us for individual achievement at the expense of the balancing effects of serotonin and oxytocin that reward us for working together and building bonds of trust and loyalty.\n\n“No one wakes up in the morning to go to work with the hope that someone will manage us. We wake up in the morning and go to work with the hope that someone will lead us.” The problem is, for us to be led, there must be leaders we want to follow.\n\nThe problem now is that we have produced an abundance of nearly everything we need or want. And we don’t do well with abundance. It can short-circuit our systems and actually do damage to us and to our organizations. Abundance can be destructive not because it is bad for us, per se. Abundance can be destructive because it abstracts the value of things. The more we have, the less we seem to value what we’ve got. And if the abstraction of stuff makes us value it less, imagine what it does to our relationships.\n\nWe no longer see each other as people; we are now customers, shareholders, employees, avatars, online profiles, screen names, e-mail addresses and expenses to be tracked. The human being really has gone virtual. Now more than ever, we are trying to work and live, be productive and happy, in a world in which we are strangers to those around us."

        "text": "**Reality**\n\nAnd that’s what trust is. We don’t just trust people to obey the rules, we also trust that they know when to break them. The rules are there for normal operations. The rules are designed to avoid danger and help ensure that things go smoothly. And though there are guidelines for how to deal with emergencies, at the end of the day, we trust the expertise of a special few people to know when to break the rules.\n\nWe cannot “trust” rules or technology. We can rely on them, for sure, but trust them? No. Trust is a very special human experience, produced by the chemical oxytocin in response to acts performed on our behalf that serve our safety and protection. True trust can only exist among people.\n\nHowever, as great as our neocortex is at helping us get things done, it is our primitive limbic brain that controls our feelings. Our ability to trust. Our ability to cooperate. Our ability to socialize and build strong communities. It is our limbic brain that feeds the gut reactions and gut decisions that drive our behavior. It gives us the ability to form strong emotional bonds with others. And these strong social bonds allow us to work together to do all the things our Homo sapiens neocortices can dream up.\n\nWhat too many leaders of organizations fail to appreciate is that it’s not the people that are the problem. The people are fine. Rather, it’s the environment in which the people operate that is the problem. Get that right and things just go.\n\nTrust and commitment are feelings that we get from the release of chemical incentives deep in our limbic brain. And as such, they are inherently hard to measure. Just as we can’t simply tell someone to be happy and expect them to be happy, we can’t just tell someone to trust us or to commit to something and expect they will. There are all sorts of things we need to do first before someone will feel any sense of loyalty or devotion."

Unfortunately, there are too many leaders of companies who believe, in the face of external challenges, that the best way to motivate their people is by creating a sense of internal urgency or pressure.\n\nPart of our advantage is thanks to the neocortex— our complex, problem-solving brain. It also gives us the ability for sophisticated communication.\n\nThere are four primary chemicals in our body that contribute to all our positive feelings that I will generically call “happy”: endorphins, dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin.\n\nHuman beings exist as individuals and as members of groups at all times.\n\nSome believe we should always put others first— that if we don’t look out for the group, the group won’t look out for us. Others believe we should always put ourselves first and that if we don’t take care of ourselves first, then we would be of no use to anyone else. The fact is, both are true.\n\nTwo chemicals— endorphins and dopamine— are the reason that we are driven to hunt, gather and achieve. They make us feel good when we find something we’re looking for, build something we need or accomplish our goals. These are the chemicals of progress.\n\nEndorphins serve one purpose and one purpose only: to mask physical pain.\n\nDopamine is the reason for the good feeling we get when we find something we’re looking for or do something that needs to get done.\n\nThat feeling of progress or accomplishment is primarily because of dopamine.\n\nIt is dopamine that makes us a goal-oriented species with a bias for progress. When we are given a task to complete, a metric to reach, as long as we can see it or clearly imagine it in our mind’s eye, we will get a little burst of dopamine to get us on our way.\n\nIt is also the reason why a corporate vision statement must be something we can see in our mind’s eye. That’s why it’s called a “vision,” because we need to be able to “see” it.\n\nShort or long term, the clearer we can see what we are setting out to achieve, the more likely we are to achieve it. It’s exciting, thanks to dopamine.\n\nWhether we like to admit it or not, we need each other. That’s where serotonin and oxytocin come in. They are the backbone of the Circle of Safety.\n\nWhen we cooperate or look out for others, serotonin and oxytocin reward us with the feelings of security, fulfillment, belonging, trust and camaraderie. When firing at the right times and for the right reasons, they can help turn any one of us into an inspiring leader, a loyal follower, a close friend, a trusted partner, a believer\n\nOxytocin and serotonin grease the social machine. And when they are missing, friction results. When the leaders of an organization create a culture that inhibits the release of these chemicals, it is tantamount to sabotage— sabotage of our careers and our happiness and sabotage of the success of the organization itself.\n\nWhat Sally Field was feeling when receiving an Oscar's award was the chemical serotonin seeping through her veins. Serotonin is the feeling of pride. It is the feeling we get when we perceive that others like or respect us. It makes us feel strong and confident, like we can take on anything.\n\nAs social animals, we more than want the approval of those in our tribe, we need it. It really matters. We all want to feel valuable for the effort we put forth for the good of others in the group or the group itself.\n\nWe want to feel that we and the work we do are valued by others, especially those in our group.\n\nSerotonin is attempting to reinforce the bond between parent and child, teacher and student, coach and player, boss and employee, leader and follower.\n\nRemember, these chemicals control our feelings. That’s why we can actually feel the weight of responsibility when others commit time and energy to support us.\n\nThe more we give of ourselves to see others succeed, the greater our value to the group and the more respect they offer us. The more respect and recognition we receive, the higher our status in the group and the more incentive we have to continue to give to the group.\n\nThose who work hardest to help others succeed will be seen by the group as the leader or the “alpha” of the group. And being the alpha— the strong, supportive one of the group, the one willing to sacrifice time and energy so that others may gain— is a prerequisite for leadership.\n\nOxytocin is most people’s favorite chemical. It’s the feeling of friendship, love or deep trust. It is the feeling we get when we’re in the company of our closest friends or trusted colleagues.\n\nWithout oxytocin, we wouldn’t want to perform acts of generosity. Without oxytocin there would be no empathy. Without oxytocin, we wouldn’t be able to develop strong bonds of trust and friendship.\n\nUnlike dopamine, which is about instant gratification, oxytocin is long-lasting. The more time we spend with someone, the more we are willing to make ourselves vulnerable around them.\n\nTo be around others like us makes us feel like we belong and gives us a sense of safety. We feel accepted as part of the group and no longer suffer the anxiety of feeling like we are on the edges.\n\nCortisol is not supposed to stay in our systems; it is supposed to fire off when we sense a threat and then leave when the threat has passed. And for good reason. The stress on our bodies is serious.\n\nUnlike gazelles, humans have sophisticated neocortices, the part of our brain responsible for language as well as rational, analytical and abstract thought. Whereas a gazelle reacts to the cortisol in their bodies, we as humans want to know the cause of our stress, to understand or make sense of our feelings.\n\nThe paranoia cortisol creates is just doing its job. It is trying to get us to find the threat and prepare for it. Fight, run or hide.\n\nOur ancient early warning system doesn’t understand that the “danger” we face is hardly life threatening. Which is why, in an effort to help us protect our interests, that system prompts us to react as if it were.\n\nIf we fear our boss doesn’t like us; if we are constantly worried that if we make a mistake, we will get in trouble; if we think that someone we work with will try to take credit for something we did or stab us in the back to get ahead; if we pay attention to too much media hype; if we fear the company isn’t going to make its numbers this year and layoffs may be around the corner; if people are generally disengaged; if we do not feel the Circle of Safety, cortisol starts to seep through our veins. Drip. Drip. Drip.\n\nThis is a serious problem. For one thing, cortisol actually inhibits the release of oxytocin, the chemical responsible for empathy. This means that when there is only a weak Circle of Safety and people must invest time and energy to guard against politics and other dangers inside the company, it actually makes us even more selfish and less concerned about one another or the organization.\n\nCortisol prepares our bodies to react suddenly— to fight or run as circumstances demand. Because this takes a lot of energy, when we feel threatened, our bodies turn off nonessential functions, such as digestion and growth.\n\nWhereas oxytocin boosts our immune system, cortisol compromises it.\n\nIn fact, we are so comfortable with alphas getting preferential treatment, on some occasions some of us may even get upset or offended if they didn’t.\n\nOur goal is to be seen as smart and strong and worthy of the advantages of an alpha. Worthy of the respect of others. All to raise our status in our community.\n\nThe reason we love rankings is because we’re hierarchical animals and there are perks to being higher in the pecking order.\n\nThe problem is, for many of the overpaid leaders, we know that they took the money and perks and didn’t offer protection to their people. In some cases, they even sacrificed their people to protect or boost their own interests. This is what so viscerally offends us. We accuse them of greed and excess only when we feel they have violated the very definition of what it means to be a leader.\n\nBut fame is supposed to be a by-product of alpha status, not a way to achieve it. The same is true for financial wealth. It is supposed to be the by-product of accomplishment, not a standard for leadership status alone.\n\nThe rank of office is not what makes someone a leader. Leadership is the choice to serve others with or without any formal rank. There are people with authority who are not leaders and there are people at the bottom rungs of an organization who most certainly are leaders.\n\nLeaders are the ones who are willing to give up something of their own for us. Their time, their energy, their money, maybe even the food off their plate. When it matters, leaders choose to eat last.\n\nAnd when we feel the Circle of Safety around us, we offer our blood and sweat and tears and do everything we can to see our leader’s vision come to life.\n\nThe only thing our leaders ever need to do is remember whom they serve and it will be our honor and pleasure to serve them back.\n\n“This is the most important lesson I can impart to all of you,” he offered. “All the perks, all the benefits and advantages you may get for the rank or position you hold, they aren’t meant for you. They are meant for the role you fill. And when you leave your role, which eventually you will, they will give the ceramic cup to the person who replaces you. Because you only ever deserved a Styrofoam cup.”\n\nTo human beings, the safety a strong tribe provides its members makes the tribe stronger and better equipped to deal with the dangers and uncertainty of the outside world.\n\nEach of the feel-good chemicals is essential for our survival as individuals and as populations. They play a role based on our needs and the environments in which we work. Our ability to work hard and muscle through hard labor is thanks to endorphins. Our ability to set goals, focus and get things done comes from the incentivizing powers of dopamine. It feels good to make progress, and so we do. Serotonin is responsible for the pride we feel when those we care for achieve great things or when we make proud the people who take care of us. Serotonin helps to ensure we look out for those who follow us and do right by those who lead us. And the mysterious power of oxytocin helps us form bonds of love and trust. It helps us form relationships so strong we can make decisions with complete confidence that those who care about us will stand by our side.\n\nThe selfish chemicals, endorphins and dopamine, give us short-term rewards to which we can, under the right conditions, become addicted. The selfless chemicals, serotonin and oxytocin, take time to build up in our systems before we can enjoy their full benefits.\n\n**We cannot motivate others, per se. Our motivation is determined by the chemical incentives inside every one of us. Any motivation we have is a function of our desire to repeat behaviors that make us feel good or avoid stress or pain. The only thing we can do is create environments in which the right chemicals are released for the right reasons.**\n\nWhen dopamine is the primary driver, we may achieve a lot but we will feel lonely and unfulfilled no matter how rich or powerful we get.\n\nWhen the system is in balance, however, we seem to gain almost supernatural ability."

        "text": "**Our need to feel safe**\n\nThat August night over Afghanistan, Johnny Bravo risked his life so that others might survive. He received no performance bonus. He didn’t get a promotion or an award at the company off-site.\n\nFor Johnny Bravo and those like him, the will to succeed and the desire to do things that advance the interests of the organization aren’t just motivated by recognition from above; they are integral to a culture of sacrifice and service, in which protection comes from all levels of the organization.\n\nif the conditions in which we work meet a particular standard, every single one of us is capable of the courage and sacrifice of a Johnny Bravo.\n\nWhat Chapman brought, in stark contrast, was a willingness to listen. As he did with every company he acquired, he started by sitting down to hear what employees had to say.\n\nEmpathy would be injected into the company and trust would be the new standard.\n\nIt may have prevented theft, but it was also a powerful reminder that management didn’t trust people.\n\nChapman understood that to earn the trust of people, the leaders of an organization must first treat them like people. To earn trust, he must extend trust.\n\nThis is what happens when the leaders of an organization listen to the people who work there. Without coercion, pressure or force, the people naturally work together to help each other and advance the company.\n\nWork is no longer a place to dread. It is a place to feel valued.\n\nWhy can’t we enjoy ourselves at work like we do when we’re not at work?\n\nTruly human leadership protects an organization from the internal rivalries that can shatter a culture. When we have to protect ourselves from each other, the whole organization suffers. But when trust and cooperation thrive internally, we pull together and the organization grows stronger as a result.\n\nAccording to the Deloitte Shift Index, 80 percent of people are dissatisfied with their jobs.\n\nReturning from work feeling inspired, safe, fulfilled and grateful is a natural human right to which we are all entitled and not a modern luxury that only a few lucky ones are able to find.\n\nEvery single employee is someone’s son or someone’s daughter. Like a parent, a leader of a company is responsible for their precious lives.\n\nThe leaders of great organizations do not see people as a commodity to be managed to help grow the money. They see the money as the commodity to be managed to help grow their people.\n\nTo see money as subordinate to people and not the other way around is fundamental to creating a culture in which the people naturally pull together to advance the business.\n\nIt is not the genius at the top giving directions that makes people great. It is great people that make the guy at the top look like a genius.\n\nAs leaders, it is our sole responsibility to protect our people and, in turn, our people will protect each other and advance the organization together.\n\nThis feeling of belonging, of shared values and a deep sense of empathy, dramatically enhances trust, cooperation and problem solving.\n\nAnd though Marines will need to learn those skills, just as we are taught skills to help us in our jobs, those things do not build the trust required for the kind of teamwork and cooperation that gets the job done better than everyone else. Those things are not what make high-performing groups perform so remarkably. The ability of a group of people to do remarkable things hinges on how well those people pull together as a team.\n\nIntimidation, humiliation, isolation, feeling dumb, feeling useless and rejection are all stresses we try to avoid inside the organization. But the danger inside is controllable and it should be the goal of leadership to set a culture free of danger from each other. And the way to do that is by giving people a sense of belonging. By offering them a strong culture based on a clear set of human values and beliefs. By giving them the power to make decisions. By offering trust and empathy. By creating a Circle of Safety.\n\nIt is easy to know when we are in the Circle of Safety because we can feel it. We feel valued by our colleagues and we feel cared for by our superiors. We become absolutely confident that the leaders of the organization and all those with whom we work are there for us and will do what they can to help us succeed.\n\nIt creates an environment for the free exchange of information and effective communication.\n\nWe cannot tell people to trust us. We cannot instruct people to come up with big ideas. And we certainly can’t demand that people cooperate. These are always results— the results of feeling safe and trusted among the people with whom we work.\n\nWhether you’re in a leadership role or not, the question is, how safe do you feel where you work?\n\nBut there is more to that reality than most of us know about. The price we pay for a perception of stability comes at its own cost. And that cost is far greater than happiness. It’s actually a matter of health. Of life and death.\n\nHaving a job we hate is as bad for our health and sometimes worse than not having a job at all.\n\nStress and anxiety at work have less to do with the work we do and more to do with weak management and leadership.\n\n**According to a Gallup poll conducted in 2013 called “State of the American Workplace,” when our bosses completely ignore us, 40 percent of us actively disengage from our work. If our bosses criticize us on a regular basis, 22 percent of us actively disengage.\n\nAnd if our bosses recognize just one of our strengths and reward us for doing what we’re good at, only 1 percent of us actively disengage from the work we’re expected to do.**\n\nResearchers found that workers’ stress was not caused by a higher degree of responsibility and pressure usually associated with rank. It is not the demands of the job that cause the most stress, but the degree of control workers feel they have throughout their day.\n\nToo many leaders are managing organizations in a way that is costing them money, hurting performance and damaging people’s health."

For example, situational leaders may adopt a democratic leadership style when discussing commercial direction with senior executives, but switch to a bureaucratic strategy when relaying new factory protocols to workers.\n\nHowever, many people have a natural leadership style, which can make switching between roles challenging. It can also be difficult to gauge what style is most suitable for certain circumstances, holding up decision-making processes."

Both styles rely heavily on the positive charm and personality of the leader in question.\n\nHowever, charismatic leadership is usually considered less favourable, largely because the success of projects and initiatives is closely linked to the presence of the leader. While transformational leaders build confidence in a team that remains when they move on, the removal of a charismatic leader typically leaves a power vacuum."

        "text": "**7 Know When to Show Dates**\n\nSome people recommend to never show dates on a product roadmap, others always include them. I recommend to use dates or timeframe on an internal roadmap that coordinates the work carried out by the internal stakeholders, such as, the development team, marketing, sales, and support. This is particularly important for date-driven products like smartphones that must be ready for Christmas sales or a travel app that has to be updated before the summer holidays start. But when you use an external roadmap that is shown to customers and users and often used as a sales tool, then I recommend not showing any dates or timeframes but sequencing your releases and possible employing a now-next-later grid to order them.",

Even if they come out on top they are still losers , and drag other people down with them when the payoff comes.fn1\n\nWinning or losing , the script is a way to structure the time between the first Hello at mother’s breast and the last Good - by at the grave .\n\nHow is it that the members of the human race , with all their accumulated wisdom , self - awareness , and desire for truth and self , can permit themselves to remain in such a mechanical situation , with its pathos and self - deception ?

        "text": "N • Does Everyone Have a Script ? At present , there is no way to answer this question with any degree of certainty , but it is certain that everyone is programed to some extent from early years .\n\nThe key lies in permissions . The more permissions Jeder has , the less he is bound by his script . On the other side , the more severely the script controls were reinforced , the more script - bound he is .\n\nChildren become aware very early in life that their parents have several sides to their characters , but they don’t know how to evaluate that until they are adolescents .\n\nAdolescence is the period when Jeder oscillates , or agonizes , between his script and his antiscript . He tries to follow his parents ’ precepts , then rebels against them , only to find himself following their script programing .\n\nA recent study of causes of death concluded that many people die when they are ready to , and that coronary thromboses , for example , can be brought about almost by an act of will .\n\nVitality in old age depends on three factors : ( 1 ) constitutional robustness ; ( 2 ) physical health ; ( 3 ) type of script .\n\nA handy situation is to have a double script : an ‘ Until ’ Script from one parent and an ‘ After ’ Script from the other . In the commonest case this reads ‘ You can’t be free until you have raised three children ’ ( from mother ) , and ‘ After you are free you will become creative ’ ( from father ) .\n\n**They say that in the next century , children will be grown in bottles , according to specifications laid down by the state and the parents , and there they will be genetically programed . But everybody is already raised in a bottle according to specifications laid down by the state and his parents , and there he is script - programed .**"

Prohibitions hamper adaptation to circumstances (nonadaptive), while permissions give a free choice. Permissions do not cause the child trouble, since there is no compulsion attached.\n\nOne of the most important permissions is a license to stop acting stupid and start thinking . Many patients of advanced years have not had a single independent thought since early childhood , and have quite forgotten how it feels to think , or even what thinking means ."

        "text": "Each person decides in early childhood how he will live and how he will die , and that plan , which he carries in his head wherever he goes , is called his script .\n\nA script requires:\n\n1. Parental directives \n2. A suitable personality development\n3. A childhood decision\n4. A real turn - on to a particular method of success or failure\n5. A convincing attitude ( or a credible stance , as they say nowadays ) .\n\nTheatrical scripts are intuitively derived from life scripts and can likewise be found in Greek drama and Greek mythology .\n\nFor the transactional script analyst , as for the play analyst , this means that if you know the plot and the character , you know what his outcome will be , unless some changes can be made .\n\nIt is incredible to think , at first , that man’s fate , all his nobility and all his degradation , is decided by a child no more than six years old , and usually three , but that is what script theory claims .\n\n1 . I + You + . This is the ‘ healthy ’ position ( or in treatment , the ‘ get well ’ one ) , the best one for decent living , the position of genuine heroes and princes , and heroines and princesses . I + You + is what the hippies were trying to tell the policeman when they gave him a flower .\n\n2 . I + You – . I’m a prince , you’re a frog . This is the ‘ get rid of ’ position . These are the people who play ‘ Blemish ’ as a pastime , a game , or a deadly procedure . They start crusades and sometimes wars , and sit in groups finding fault with their real or imagined inferiors or enemies . This is the ‘ arrogant ’ position , at worst a killer’s , and at best a meddler’s for people who make it their business to help the ‘ not - OK others ’ with things they don’t want to be helped with . But for the most part it is a position of mediocrities , and clinically it is paranoid .\n\n3. I – You + . This is psychologically the ‘ depressive ’ position , politically and socially a self - abasement transmitted to the children . Occupationally , it leads people to live by choice on favors large and small and enjoy it with a vengeance , that being the poor satisfaction of making the other pay as much as possible for his OK stamp . These are melancholic suicides , losers who call themselves gamblers , people who get rid of themselves instead of others by isolating themselves in obscure rooming houses or canyons or by getting a ticket to prison or the psychiatric ward . It is the position of the ‘ If Onlys ’ and ‘ I Should Haves . ’\n\n4 . I – You – . This is the ‘ futility ’ position of the Why Notters : Why not kill yourself , Why not go crazy . Clinically , it is schizoid or schizophrenic.\n\nThese positions are universal among all mankind , because all mankind nurses at his mother’s breast or bottle and gets the message there , and later has it reinforced when he learns his manners , whether in the jungle , the slum , the condominium , or the ancestral halls .\n\nBecause each person is the product of a million different moments , a thousand states of mind , a hundred adventures , and usually two different parents , a thorough investigation of his position will reveal many complexities and apparent contradictions .\n\nNevertheless , there can usually be detected one basic position , sincere or insincere , inflexible or insecure , on which his life is staked , and from which he plays out his games and script .\n\nthe four basic positions , ( 1 ) I + You + ( success ) ; ( 2 ) I + You – ( arrogant ) ; ( 3 ) I – You + ( depressive ) ; and ( 4 ) I – You – ( futility ) , can rarely be changed by external circumstances alone .\n\nIn order to verify predictions , it is necessary to define success , that is , winners and losers . A winner is someone who succeeds in what he says he is going to do . A loser is someone who fails to accomplish what he sets out to do .\n\nThe simplest positions , the most difficult to deal with , and the most dangerous for society , are those which are based on a single pair of OK - not - OK adjectives : Black - White , Rich - Poor , Christian - Pagan , Bright - Stupid , Jew - Aryan , Honest - Crooked .\n\nThe child is born free , but he soon learns different . During the first two years he is programed mainly by his mother .\n\nParental programing determines how and when the urges are expressed , and how and when the restraints are imposed . It uses the circuits which are already built in , and sets them up in a certain way in order to get certain results or payoffs . As a result of this programing , new qualities emerge , which are compromises between urges and controls . From acquisitiveness and renunciation emerge patience ; from maleness or femaleness and reticence emerge masculinity and femininity ; from fighting and restraint emerge shrewdness , and from messiness and orderliness come tidiness . All these qualities : patience , masculinity and femininity , shrewdness , and tidiness are taught by the parents and programed in during the plastic years between two and six .\n\nWhen parents interfere with or try to influence their children’s free expression , their directives are interpreted differently by the parent , the onlookers , and the child himself . In fact there are five different viewpoints . ( 1 ) What the parent says he meant . ( 2 ) What a naive onlooker thinks he meant . ( 3 ) The literal meaning of what was said . ( 4 ) What the parent ‘ really ’ meant . ( 5 ) What the child gets out of it . The first two are ‘ square ’ or ‘ Earthian , ’ and the last three are ‘ real ’ or Martian .\n\nMartian thinking enables the child to find out what the parents ‘ really ’ want , that is , what they will respond most favorably to .\n\nThe Adapted Child wants and needs to behave in an adapted way , and tries to avoid nonadaptive behavior or even nonadaptive feelings , which will get less than the best responses from those around him . Meanwhile his self - expressive or Natural Child must be held in leash . The balance between the two forms of behavior is held by the Adult in the child ( AC in Figure 7 ) , which must behave like an exceedingly agile computer in order to decide what is necessary and what is permissible from moment to moment in each situation . This Adult becomes very adept at figuring out what people want or will tolerate , or at worst , what they will get the most excited or angry about , or perhaps feel the most guilty , helpless , scared , or hurt about . Thus the Adult in the child is a keen and perceptive student of human nature , and is therefore called the Professor .\n\nAfter he has learned Martian thinking , so that he has a sound Adapted Child , the Professor turns his attention to legal thinking , in order to find more ways for the Natural Child to express himself .\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "The principles of transactional analysis have been described previously on numerous occasions .\n\n* Games People Play\n* A Layman’s Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis .\n\nEach human being exhibits three types of ego states . ( 1 ) Those derived from parental figures , colloquially called the Parent . In this state , he feels , thinks , acts , talks , and responds just as one of his parents did when he was little . This ego state is active , for example , in raising his own children . Even when he is not actually exhibiting this ego state , it influences his behavior as the ‘ Parental influence , ’ performing the functions of a conscience . ( 2 ) The ego state in which he appraises his environment objectively , and calculates its possibilities and probabilities on the basis of past experience , is called the Adult ego state , or the Adult . The Adult functions like a computer . ( 3 ) Each person carries within a little boy or little girl , who feels , thinks , acts , talks , and responds just the way he or she did when he or she was a child of a certain age . This ego state is called the Child . The Child is not regarded as ‘ childish ’ or ‘ immature , ’ which are Parental words , but as ‘ childlike , ’ meaning like a child of a certain age , and the important factor here is the age , which may be anywhere between two and five years in ordinary circumstances . It is important for the individual to understand his Child , not only because it is going to be with him all his life , but also because it is the most valuable part of his personality .\n\nThese are the ones described above , Type I ( AA – CP ) , the transference reaction ; and Type II ( AA – PC ) , the counter - transference reaction ; plus Type III ( CP – AA ) , the ‘ exasperating response , ’ where someone who wants sympathy gets facts instead , and Type IV ( PC – AA ) ,\n\nSince this system as a whole , in all its branches , is referred to as transactional analysis , what has been described above , the analysis of single transactions , is called transactional analysis proper , which is the second step after structural analysis . Transactional analysis proper gives a rigorous definition of the system as a whole , which will be of interest principally to those trained in scientific methodology . A transaction consisting of a single stimulus and a single response , verbal or nonverbal , is the unit of social action . It is called a transaction because each party gains something from it , and that is why he engages in it . 6 Anything that happens between two or more people can be broken down into a series of single transactions , and this gives all the advantages which any science attains when it has a well - defined system of units .\n\nThe need to structure time is based on three drives or hungers . \n\n1. The first is stimulus or sensation hunger .\n2. The second drive is recognition hunger , the quest for special kinds of sensations which can only be supplied by another human being , or in some cases , by other animals .\n3. The third hunger is structure hunger , which is why groups tend to grow into organizations , and why time - structurers are among the most sought after and the most highly rewarded members of any society .\n\nThere are four basic classifications for the short - term structuring of time in human social behavior , with two limiting cases .\n\n* withdrawal\n* rituals\n* activities\n* pastimes\n\nGames are sets of ulterior transactions , repetitive in nature , with a well - defined psychological payoff . Since an ulterior transaction means that the agent pretends to be doing one thing while he is really doing something else , all games involve a con .\n\nBeyond games lies the other limiting case of what can take place between people , which is called intimacy . Bilateral intimacy is defined as a candid , game - free relationship , with mutual free giving and receiving and without exploitation . Intimacy can be one - sided , since one party may be candid and freely giving , while the other may be devious and exploitative .\n\nThe above forms of social action are ways of structuring time with the object of avoiding boredom and at the same time getting the greatest possible satisfaction out of each situation .\n\nScripts are usually based on childlike illusions which may persist throughout a whole lifetime ; but in more sensitive , perceptive , and intelligent people these illusions dissolve one by one , leading to the various life crises described by Erikson . Among these crises are the adolescent reappraisal of parents ; the protests , often bizarre , of middle age ; and the emergence of philosophy after that .\n\nTime structuring is an objective term for the existential problem of what to do after saying Hello ."

        "text": "What do you say after you say hello contains both the primal question of social psychology: Why do people talk to each other? and the primal question of social psychiatry: Why do people like to be liked?\n\nTo say Hello rightly is to see the other person, to be aware of him as a phenomenon, to happen to him and to be ready for him to happen to you.\n\nOne of the rare jewels of the world is the genuine Fijian smile . It starts slowly , it illuminates the whole face , it rests there long enough to be clearly recognized and to recognize clearly , and it fades with secret slowness as it passes by .\n\nThe way people speak who are learning to say Hello is called ‘ Martian , ’ to distinguish it from everyday Earth - talk , which , as history shows from the earliest recorded times in Egypt and Babylonia to the present , has led to wars , famines , pestilence , and death ; and , in the survivors , to a certain amount of mental confusion . It is hoped that in the long run , Martian , properly learned and properly taught , will help to eliminate these plagues . Martian , for example , is the language of dreams , which show things the way they really are .\n\nThe time and effort they spent covering up were blackmail payments made to death , which prevented them from fully enjoying life .\n\nThus , the three stages were represented by the superficial Hello , the tense , sympathetic Hello , and the relaxed , real Hello .\n\nZoe cannot say Hello to Mort until she knows who he is and that can change from week to week , or even from hour to hour . Each time she meets him , she knows a little more about him than she did the last time , and she must say Hello to him in a slightly different way if she wants to keep up with their advancing friendship . But since she can never know all about him , nor anticipate all the changes , she can never say a perfect Hello , but only come closer and closer to it .\n\n\n"

        "text": "Having an idea for a new product is great. But it’s not enough. What you need is a vision that guides everyone involved in making the product a success: product management, development, marketing, sales, and support. The product vision is the overarching goal you are aiming for, the reason for creating the product. It provides a continued purpose in an ever-changing world, acts as the product’s true north, provides motivation when the going gets tough, and facilitates effective collaboration.\n\nTo choose the right vision, ask yourself why you are excited to work on the product, why you care about it, what positive change the product should bring about, and how it will shape the future.\n\nYour product vision should not be a plan that shows how to reach your goal. Instead, you should keep the product vision and the product strategy – the path towards the goal – separate. This enables to change your strategy while staying grounded in your vision. (This is called to pivot in Lean Startup.)\n\n",

        "text": "“Once formed,” the researchers observed dryly, “impressions are remarkably perseverant.”\n\nEven after the evidence “for their beliefs has been totally refuted, people fail to make appropriate revisions in those beliefs,” the researchers noted.\n\nConsider what’s become known as “confirmation bias,” the tendency people have to embrace information that supports their beliefs and reject information that contradicts them.\n\nPeople believe that they know way more than they actually do.\n\n“As a rule, strong feelings about issues do not emerge from deep understanding,” Sloman and Fernbach write.\n\nIf we spent less time pontificating and more trying to work through the implications of policy proposals, we’d realize how clueless we are and moderate our views. \n\nThe Gormans, too, argue that ways of thinking that now seem self-destructive must at some point have been adaptive.\n\n“The Enigma of Reason,” “The Knowledge Illusion,” and “Denying to the Grave” were all written before the November election. And yet they anticipate Kellyanne Conway and the rise of “alternative facts.” These days, it can feel as if the entire country has been given over to a vast psychological experiment being run either by no one or by Steve Bannon. Rational agents would be able to think their way to a solution. But, on this matter, the literature is not reassuring."

There is a balance between being upfront and vulnerable.\n\nAssessment\nTools\n\n**Adaptability**\n\n**Achievement** is setting agoal and reaching it.\n\n2x Annually review values, beliefs and roles. Set objectives and assign a timeline. Review weekly and daily & adjust as needed.\n\n**Initiative**\n\n**Optimism**\n\nNLP anchors are a connection between the stimulus and response. The good news is that you can apply the anchoring to feel *optmistic* on demand. Create a trigger to an anchor - something like rubbing a finger and test it.\n",

        "text": "**Transactional analysis**\n\nIs a psychoanalytic theory and method of therapy wherein social transactions are analyzed to determine the ego state of the patient (whether parent-like, child-like, or adult-like) as a basis for understanding behavior.[1] In transactional analysis, the patient is taught to alter the ego state as a way to solve emotional problems. \n\nBerne mapped interpersonal relationships to three ego-states of the individuals involved: the Parent, Adult, and Child state. He then investigated communications between individuals based on the current state of each. He called these interpersonal interactions transactions and used the label games to refer to certain patterns of transactions which popped up repeatedly in everyday life.\n\nThere are four life positions that a person can hold, and holding a particular psychological position has profound implications for how an individual operationalizes his or her life. The positions are stated as:\n\n* I'm OK and you are OK. This is the healthiest position about life and it means that I feel good about myself and that I feel good about others and their competence.\n* I'm OK and you are not OK. In this position I feel good about myself but I see others as damaged or less than and it is usually not healthy,\n* I'm not OK and you are OK. In this position the person sees him/herself as the weak partner in relationships as the others in life are definitely better than the self. The person who holds this position will unconsciously accept abuse as OK.\n* I'm not OK and you are not OK. This is the worst position to be in as it means that I believe that I am in a terrible state and the rest of the world is as bad. Consequently, there is no hope for any ultimate supports.[8]\n\nPhilosophy\n\n* People are OK; thus each person has validity, importance, equality of respect.\n* Positive reinforcement increases feelings of being OK.\n* All people have a basic lovable core and a desire for positive growth.\n* Everyone (with only few exceptions, such as the severely brain-damaged) has the capacity to think.\n* All of the many facets of an individual have a positive value for them in some way.\n* People decide their story and destiny, therefore these decisions can be changed.\n* All emotional difficulties are curable.\n\nMany of the core TA models and concepts can be categorised into\n\n* Structural analysis – analysis of the individual psyche\n* Transactional analysis proper – analysis of interpersonal transactions based on structural analysis of the individuals involved in the transaction\n* Game analysis – repeating sequences of transactions that lead to a result subconsciously agreed to by the parties involved in the game\n* Script analysis – a life plan that may involve long-term involvement in particular games in order to reach the life pay-off of the individual\n\nAt any given time, a person experiences and manifests his or her personality through a mixture of behaviours, thoughts, and feelings. Typically, according to TA, there are three ego-states that people consistently use:\n\n* Parent (\"exteropsyche\"): a state in which people behave, feel, and think in response to an unconscious mimicking of how their parents (or other parental figures) acted, or how they interpreted their parent's actions. For example, a person may shout at someone out of frustration because they learned from an influential figure in childhood the lesson that this seemed to be a way of relating that worked.\n* Adult (\"neopsyche\"): a state of the ego which is most like an artificially intelligent system processing information and making predictions about major emotions that could affect its operation. Learning to strengthen the Adult is a goal of TA. While a person is in the Adult ego state, he/she is directed towards an objective appraisal of reality.\n* Child (\"archaeopsyche\"): a state in which people behave, feel, and think similarly to how they did in childhood. For example, a person who receives a poor evaluation at work may respond by looking at the floor and crying or pouting, as when scolded as a child. Conversely, a person who receives a good evaluation may respond with a broad smile and a joyful gesture of thanks. The Child is the source of emotions, creation, recreation, spontaneity, and intimacy.\n\n",

        "text": "**Eric Berne**\n\nCreated the theory of transactional analysis as a way of explaining human behavior. Berne’s theory of transactional analysis was based on the ideas of Freud but were distinctly different. Freudian psychotherapists focused on talk therapy as a way of gaining insight to their patient’s personalities. \n\nBerne mapped interpersonal relationships to three ego-states of the individuals involved: the Parent, Adult, and Child state. He then investigated communications between individuals based on the current state of each. He called these interpersonal interactions transactions and used the label games to refer to certain patterns of transactions which popped up repeatedly in everyday life.\n\n*Games people play*\n\nThe book describes both functional and dysfunctional social interactions.\nThe essence of games described by Berne are that they are not zero-sum games, (i.e. one must win at the other's expense), where the person who benefits from a transaction wins the game. On the contrary, the \"games people play\" usually pay all of the players off, even those who ostensibly are the losers, since they are about psychic equilibrium or promoting adopted self-damaging social roles instead of rational benefits. These payoffs are not consciously sought by the players but they are leading to the ultimate unconscious life script of each as set by their parental family interactions and favored emotions."

        "text": "**Epilogue: A New Civic Religion**\n\nI hope this book helps to show how entrepreneurship can be part of this solution by: \n\n* Creating new sources of growth and prosperity. \n* Cultivating a new cohort of leaders among all generations who are not bound by convention or obligation to the ideas of the past yet are yoked through long-term incentives and mindset to the possibilities of the future. \n* Integrating scientific thinking into every kind of work. \n* Providing new opportunities for leadership to people of every background and circumstance.\n* Helping public policy become more long-term in its objectives.\n\nThe good news is, this new organizational form is more effective, treats talent and energy as a precious resource, and is designed to harness the true source of competitive advantage in the years to come: human creativity. Every organization owes this simple bill of rights to its every member: \n\n1. The right to know that the work I do all day is meaningful to someone other than my boss. \n2. The right to have my idea turned into a minimum viable product and evaluated rigorously and fairly. \n3. The right to become an entrepreneur at any time, as long as I’m willing to do the hard work to make things happen with limited resources. \n4. The right to stay involved with my idea as it scales, as long as I am contributing productively to its growth. \n5. The right to equity ownership in the growth I help to create, no matter my role or job title.\n\nOur goal as a movement should be this: to change management practice to become more adaptive, more humane, more rigorous, and more efficient. If we are successful, I believe the benefits will be immense for society at large: \n\n1. A change in incentives from short-term to long-term. \n2. A reversal in the decline of new-business formation by making entrepreneurship more accessible to all. \n3. A reversal in the trend toward the bureaucracy of large organizations and, therefore,\n4. More growth through organic breakthroughs in customer delight, rather than simply mergers, reorgs, and financial engineering. \n5. The opportunity to redesign our economy to be more inclusive, more sustainable, and more innovative— all at the same time."

        "text": "**Part Three: The big picture**\n\nThe right approach once a transformation has achieved scale is to start a new transformation, with a new founder and a new startup team. Test, experiment, and learn. See how or if the new approach improves on the previous one. And, depending on what those experiments show, integrate the new approach into the existing system or replace that system entirely. As always, experiments give us the luxury to think boldly without taking excessive risk but also the ability to scale up in a hurry if our bold bets pay off.\n\nIn other words, just as The Lean Startup argued for a shift in thinking from innovation to continuous innovation, I hope this book will leave you with a hunger not only for transformation but for continuous transformation.\n\nThink back to the original definition of a startup I settled on more than five years ago: a human institution designed to build a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.\n\nRequires a special sort of person to pull it off. It requires: \n\n* Leadership skills of a most distinctive kind, since transformation pits its leader against the hostile reactions of experienced people whose lives and careers are deeply invested in the status quo. \n* Audacious experimentation, since beyond the general framework I’ve presented so far, every organization has to find its own distinctive shape, its own unique adaptations to the specific context in which it operates. \n* The boldness to invest in sweeping, company-wide change— and the patience to wait until just the right moment to make this commitment. The discipline to start with small experiments that might hasten the arrival of the right moment without growing too big, too bloated, too fast. \n* The most difficult kind of cross-functional collaboration: enlisting functional leaders in the creation of new and competing functions, thereby breaking down old functional silos and requiring old enemies to make common cause.\n\n1. Assigns responsibility for the entrepreneurship function to somebody (too many orgs have nobody). \n2. Gives these people real operating responsibility instead of designating them merely as futurists or instigators (as too many “chief innovation officers” are). \n3. Builds a career path and a specialized performance development process for entrepreneurial talent (producing a common standard that can be used across the pillars, no matter which function or division is affected). \n4. Facilitates cross-training of entrepreneurs across the pillars. (This is why VCs who have had real-world operating experience as founders are so highly prized, though I should note the many VCs who have succeeded despite not having it. What matters is the mindset, not the résumé.) \n5. Offers training, mentorship, support, coaching, and best practices designed to foster excellence in entrepreneurship across the organization. \n6. Somewhat counterintuitively, takes responsibility for educating the non-entrepreneurs in the organization, who, though not necessarily acting as drivers of change, will still need to adopt a more entrepreneurial way of working. \n7. Gives entrepreneurship a seat at the table when the other functions— especially gatekeeper functions— are setting company policy. This is incredibly important for finance, legal, HR, and IT in particular.\n\nContinuous transformation— an organization’s capability to test and learn from experiments having to do with its own structure and processes, promoting the best-proven techniques company-wide while limiting or discarding the rest— is what will give that organization the ability to thrive in the modern era. It’s my last suggestion as an addition to the toolbox of the entrepreneurial management function.\n\nThis is the true promise of the Startup Way: a management system that contains within it the seeds of its own evolution by providing an opportunity for every employee to become an entrepreneur."

        "text": "**Part Two - A Roadmap for Transformation**\n\nPart Two tackles the real and difficult details of how to move an organization to a more effective, entrepreneurial way of working, and it answers three fundamental questions: \n\n1. What, exactly, are the systems and structures we need to implement? \n2. How, exactly, do we convince managers and employees alike to try something different than what they’ve known their whole careers? (Remember, even in a hypergrowth startup, most employees were not present for the founding of the company.) \n3. When, exactly, is a company ready to make this transformation happen?\n\n**Phase One** is about laying the foundation through experimentation, adaptation, and translation. It is about preparing for the moment when decisive change becomes possible by building a critical mass of success stories and demonstrating that the new way of working is not only viable but preferable.\n\n**Phase Two**, which is for rapid scaling and deployment. All the resisters and objectors come out of the woodwork. The transformation either develops its own political heft or it dies.\n\n**Phase Three**: dealing with the deep systems of the corporation. Here, finally, it becomes possible to address the structures that cause people, again and again, to return to the old ways.\n\n* Start with a limited number of projects and build from there in order to create a comprehensive set of cases, stories, and results to show how the new method works in this particular organization. \n* Create dedicated, cross-functional teams to undertake the pilot projects in order to embed functional diversity from the start. \n* Create a growth board– type system that allows executives to make swift, clear decisions about the projects presented to them.\n* Teach early teams how to design Lean Startup– type experiments that help them plot a course through uncertain terrain. \n* Use the right startup-style metrics to measure the results of those experiments. * Build a network of leaders in the organization who can help resolve problems that come up as the new way of working comes into conflict with entrenched methods. Work by exception at the start in order to move forward quickly and to defer deep changes to organizational structures until later phases. \n* Translate the new concepts into company-specific language and tools.\n\n1. Start Small\n2. Build Dedicated, Cross-Functional Teams\n3. Wield the Golden Sword\n4. Design a Good Experiment\n\nEvery experiment should have:\n\n* A clear falsifiable hypothesis.\n* An obvious next action.\n* Strict risk containment.\n* A tie between what is measured and at least one LOFA.\n\nTrue to corporate form there was a lot of pressure to ensure a 100 percent success rate. This kind of thinking, of course, is incompatible with startup thinking, which understands failure and experimentation as part of the methodology.\n\nIn Lean Startup terms, we understand cycle time as build-measure-learn, which means that sometimes nontechnical parts of the cycle can be collapsed through business model changes.\n\nLeading indicators come in many forms. Their purpose is to track signs that the process is working at the team level.\n\nA little farther along on the path of experimentation, it’s important to create metrics to measure the success of entrepreneurial projects. This entails replacing traditional metrics— often ROI— with validated learning: scientifically gathered information based on frequent experiments.\n\nWe used to measure too many damn things that did not have anything to do with the actual business value created. Now they have a list of four: \n\n(1) how fast a team can get a new task done; \n(2) how many tasks a team can complete in the course of one regular work cycle (however long that is); \n(3) how long it takes for a task pulled out of the backlog lineup to get into production; and \n(4) how long a task has been sitting in the backlog, which includes pruning projects that have been made irrelevant by the passage of time.\n\nIf everyone can understand it without a manual, people start getting better at a faster rate.\n\nMetrics are critical, Lefler says, because “when leadership can’t measure results, the common response is to require all decisions to go up to their level. The first-order effect of better measurements is better decision making. The second-order effect is that leadership gives high-performing teams the autonomy to act faster and focus their attention on the right things.”\n\nEvery team that’s working in the Startup Way needs to have someone in company leadership they can call upon, when needed, to resolve the toughest problems they face when interacting with the wider organization.\n\nGE Beliefs at the annual officers’ meeting in August of 2014: \n\n1. Customers determine our success. \n2. Stay lean to go fast. \n3. Learn and adapt to win. \n4. Empower and inspire each other. \n5. Deliver results in an uncertain world.\n\n* Review and identify challenges faced by Phase One teams and projects. \n* Develop and roll out a widespread system for working in the new way. \n* Identify and make proper use of executive-level champions to reinforce the new methods. \n* Bring internal functions into the transformation process. \n* Create an internal coaching program. \n* Establish growth boards and begin to use metered funding for resource allocation.\n\n“Technology adoption life cycle,” outlined in his book Crossing the Chasm.\n\nA major challenge that innovation teams face in Phase Two is resistance from within. Most resistance comes from a totally valid place: managers who have been trained throughout their careers to act in a specific way. I’m often tasked with giving executives the bad news that they’re paying people to inhibit innovation in their organizations.\n\nEstablish an In-House Coaching Program\n\n**If there is one piece of advice that the Lean Startup movement is known for above all, it’s the importance of getting customers involved early and often.**\n\nWhat mentors should consider if they want to build effective relationships with the entrepreneurs they’re working with.” \n\n* Be Socratic. \n* Expect nothing in return (you’ll be delighted with what you do get back). \n* Be authentic/ practice what you preach. \n* Be direct. Tell the truth, however hard. \n* Listen, too. \n* The best mentor relationships eventually become two-way. \n* Be responsive. \n* Adopt at least one company every single year. Experience counts. \n* Clearly separate opinion from fact. \n* Hold information in confidence. \n* Clearly commit to mentor or do not. Either is fine. \n* Know what you don’t know. Say “I don’t know” when you don’t know. “I don’t know” is preferable to bravado. \n* Guide, don’t control. Teams must make their own decisions. Guide but never tell them what to do. Understand that it’s their company, not yours.\n* Accept and communicate with other mentors who get involved. \n* Be optimistic. \n* Provide specific actionable advice; don’t be vague. \n* Be challenging/ robust but never destructive. \n* Have empathy. Remember that startups are hard.\n\nThe coaches focus on three areas: leadership practices, collaboration practices, and technical practices. Coaching isn’t mandatory, but each cross-functional team of eight to ten people is assessed every quarter, and the results are made public via a scoreboard, which provides incentive to take advantage of the program.\n\nAt Cisco, coaching is part of a program called My Innovation, which works alongside Cisco’s other innovation initiatives with the broad purpose of engaging, empowering, and enabling its 70,000 employees to experiment with new ideas. To date, two thousand people have signed up to go through coach training. Goal is to train coaches for three areas: innovation (design thinking and agile prototyping), business (sales and marketing), and technical.\n\nRies, Eric.

        "text": "**Part One - The Modern Company**\n\nHypergrowth for a company also requires hypergrowth of the people inside it.\n\nMost business leaders recognize that the everyday challenges of executing their core business leave little time and energy for harnessing and testing new ideas.\n\nThis setup flips Karl Marx’s old dictum on its head. What he called the means of production can now be rented. Entire global supply chains can be borrowed at little more than the marginal cost of the underlying products they produce. This dramatically lowers the initial capital costs required to try something new.\n\nThe structure that Alfred Sloan pioneered became the basis for all of twentieth-century general management. You can’t run a multiproduct, multidivision, multinational company and its attendant global supply chains without it. It is one of the true revolutionary ideas of the past one hundred years and is still widely in use today. Everyone knows the drill: beat your forecast, your stock goes up, you get promoted. Miss it and watch out.\n\nSometimes, failure to hit the forecast means a team executed poorly. But sometimes it means the forecast itself was a fantasy. How can we tell the difference?\n\nA modern company is one that has both halves, both systems. It has a capacity to produce products with great reliability and quality, but also to discover what new products to produce.\n\nA modern company is one in which every employee has the opportunity to be an entrepreneur. It respects its employees and their ideas at a fundamental level. A modern company is disciplined at the rigorous execution of its core business— without discipline, no innovation is possible— but it also employs a complementary set of entrepreneurial management tools for dealing with situations of extreme uncertainty.\n\n**and many mores**\n\nWhen I meet with CEOs, I often ask them: Who in your organization is responsible right now for the following two things? \n\n1. Overseeing high-potential growth initiatives that could one day become new divisions of the company. \n2. Infusing everyday work across the organization with an entrepreneurial, experimental, iterative mindset.\n\nModern companies need something more than just another innovation lab. They need something more than R& D and prototyping, something distinct from the secretive skunkworks projects of old. They need the ability to consistently and reliably make bets on high-risk, high-reward projects without having to bet the whole company. And they need to find, train, and retain the kinds of leaders who can pull this off. After witnessing and working with many companies, large and small, grappling with this, I believe we should simply call this function “entrepreneurship.”\n\nThe entrepreneurs who lead these startups require a distinct career path with its own performance development standards of best practices and metrics for success, including mentorship in the high-impact techniques that accelerate growth.\n\nOne of the key responsibilities of the entrepreneurial function is to weave startup thinking into the cultural fabric of the organization,\n\nFocus on the leadership challenge of giving teams the freedom to create experiments while still holding them to strong accountability standards.\n\nThe investor saw our presentation as a window into the way we thought— and the way we acted. We demonstrated fast cycle time, rigorous scientific decision making, product/ design savvy, and good use of limited resources.\n\nIf you passionately believe in a mission but lack the resources to make it unfurl in every possible way, you’re absolutely forced to focus. There’s simply no extra time and no extra money, and corporate death threatens at any moment. 4 That’s why, in the tech industry especially, small teams put a huge premium on reusing existing technology and assembling products out of preexisting components.\n\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve worked with teams in traditional enterprises that literally don’t know what problem they are trying to solve from the customer’s point of view.\n\nStartup equity is a complex financial derivative that powers the entire venture/ startup ecosystem. It’s not profit-sharing. It’s not a union. But it is the greatest tool of employee empowerment I’ve ever seen.\n\nNo business plan survives first contact with customers.\nPlans are useless, but planning is indispensable.\n\nWE BELIEVE IN MERITOCRACY\nOUR CULTURE IS EXPERIMENTAL AND ITERATIVE\nA STARTUP IS MISSION— AND VISION— DRIVEN\nWE BELIEVE IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A CAREER PATH\n\n**HOW THE LEAN STARTUP WORKS**\n\n1. Identify the beliefs about what must be true in order for the startup to succeed. We call these leap-of-faith assumptions. \n2. Create an experiment to test those assumptions as quickly and inexpensively as possible. We call this initial effort a minimum viable product. \n3. Think like a scientist. Treat each experiment as an opportunity to learn what’s working and what’s not. We call this “unit of progress” for startups validated learning. \n4. Take the learning from each experiment and start the loop over again. This cycle of iteration is called the build-measure-learn feedback loop. \n5. On a regular schedule (cadence), make a decision about whether to make a change in strategy (pivot) or stay the course (persevere).\n\n1. Do people really have the problem you think they do? \n2. How do they approach the problem today? \n3. Is your concept a better alternative for them?\n\nAmong its leap-of-faith assumptions, a startup has two that are fundamental: the value hypothesis, 4 which tests whether a product or service really delights customers once they begin using it; and the growth hypothesis, which tests how, given some customers, it’s possible to get more.\n\nDone is better than perfect."

What does the other side want? How do these goals intersect or conflict?\n\nIssues: What issues does each side want to see addressed? In what order? What are the real priorities on each side? What are the false priorities and distractions?\n\nInterests: Why do you want the things you want? Why is the other side asking for what it wants? Which of these interests could be mutually satisfied?\n\nAllies: Who are your allies and how can they help you get what you want? Do you have any allies who are on the same level in the hierarchy as your opponent? Can you enlist their support?\n\nEnvironment: What setting will be most comfortable for you and your opponent when you meet to negotiate? What kind of environment will send a message of collaboration, informality, and comfort?\n\nRespect: What can you do or say to communicate to the other side that you respect and value them and your relationship? How can you send a message of commitment to collaboration before the negotiation?\n\nBATNA: What is each side's \"best alternative to a negotiated agreement\"? What is the best that could happen if no agreement is reached? What would you do if that happens?\n\nWATNA: What is each side's \"worst alternative to a negotiated agreement\"? What is the worst that could happen if no agreement is reached? What would you do if that happens?\n\nOptions: What creative solutions can you identify that could satisfy both of your interests? Can you think of any others?\n\nRelationships and communication: What impact will either side's proposed solutions have on your ongoing relationship and communication?\n\nCriteria: Are there criteria or standards that could help you agree on what is fair?\n\nReality testing: Are the ideas that either side is proposing realistic? Will they work for both sides? What could go wrong in implementing them?\n\nSatisfaction: What do both of you need in terms of content, process, and relationship to feel satisfied or pleased with the outcome?\n\nCommitment: What are both sides willing to commit to doing to make the proposed solution work? Is there genuine commitment? If not, what is needed to create it?\n\nImprovement: What can you do in these negotiations to improve trust and make the next round of negotiations more successful?\n\nCompletion: What can you do to complete the process so neither side has any lingering anger, distrust, or doubt? What can you do to complete the process and reach closure with the other side so neither of you has remaining unresolved negative feelings?"

        "text": "**Chapter 6. SOLVE PROBLEMS PARADOXICALLY AND CREATIVELY**\n\nThe first stage in resolving conflicts consists of:\n\n* opening them up, \n* encouraging them to unfold, \n* and seeing what lies hidden within. \n\nThese are encompassed in the first set of five strategies. \n**Once we have listened deeply to our opponent and discovered the hidden nature of our conflicts, the second stage, consisting of five strategies, begins:**\n\n* with searching for creative solutions to the paradoxical problems we have uncovered; \n* learning from difficult behaviors; \n* leading toward resolution and transformation; \n* exploring resistance, collaboratively negotiating and mediating solutions; \n* and designing systems, structures, processes, relationships and cultures that can prevent chronic conflicts and enable us to transcend them.\n\nThere are **three important conceptual or attitudinal shifts** in initiating creative problem solving. \n\n1. First, we need to put aside the assumption that ours is the only solution, let go of the need to punish our opponent, and realize that the conflict does not have to end in a win-lose outcome.\n2. Second, we need to recognize that problem solving works best when it is collaborative, open, and inclusive of everyone who is affected by the problem.\n3. Third, we need to accept that there is more than one truth in our conflicts, making both our problems and their solutions paradoxical. If we view our problems as complex and multifaceted, and approach them with a learning orientation, we will discover that the paradoxes, enigmas, riddles, and contradictions that can be found at their core will lead us to more creative, successful, multidimensional solutions.\n\nThe greatest obstacle to adopting a positive approach is the persistence of negative emotions.\n\nTake a look at figure **Orientation to Problem Solving**.\n\nTake a look at figure **Theory X and Theory Y**.\n\n**Five Steps in Creative Problem Solving**\n\n1. Step One: Admit You Have a Problem, Recognize It as a Problem, and Accept It as Needing to Be Solved\n2. Step Two: Collaboratively Define and Clarify the Elements and Nature of the Problem\n3. Step Three: Jointly Investigate, Analyze, Categorize, and Prioritize the Problem\n4. Step Four: Invent Solutions That Satisfy Everyone's Interests Without Becoming Attached to Any Particular Solution\n5. Step Five: Jointly Act, Evaluate Results, Acknowledge Efforts, and Celebrate Successes\n\n**Democratic strategic planning** encourages people at all levels in the organization to participate in redefining their future—especially those whose participation is essential for any long-range plan to succeed.\n\n* Values: What are our ethical principles and shared values? What ideals do we want to stand for? What can we do to make sure we live up to them?\n* Vision: Where do we want to go? What do we want to ultimately achieve? Why?\n* Mission: Who are we? What are our main strengths and weaknesses? What do we do best?\n* Barriers: What stands or might stand in the way of getting where we want to go?\n* Strategies: How can we successfully overcome these barriers in a way that is consistent with our values and who we are? How do we get to where we finally want to go?\n* Goals or objectives: What do we have to achieve in the next year to get where we want to go? How do we break our strategies down into achievable subparts?\n* Action plans: Who is going to do what to achieve each one of our goals? What is our target deadline? What resources do we need to be successful?\n\nThere are **six fundamental decision-making processes** from which individuals, teams, and organizations can choose in solving their problems. Rather than pick one as a template for all situations, it is better to become fluent in all six and select the one that will be most effective in each decision. These basic methods of decision making, followed by an illustrative phrase that expresses it, are\n\n* *Notification*: \"The following decision has been made and will be implemented by Friday.\"\n* *Consultation*: \"I would like your thoughts on this issue before I make a decision.\"\n* *Delegation*: \"You decide, and I will support what you decided.\"\n* *Voting*: \"The majority will decide.\"\n* *Consensus*: \"I am willing to accept the wisdom of the group, can live with the decision, and feel it addresses my most important needs and interests.\"\n* *Unanimity*: \"We are in 100 percent agreement.\"\n\nIf we believe the problem is who the other person is or what she is doing, a far more interesting problem is who we are and why we are having so much difficulty responding skillfully to her personality or behavior. In this way, **every external solution we identify and conflict we resolve corresponds to an internal one that is subtly demanding our attention**.\n\nThe greatest and most important problems of life are all in a certain sense insoluble. They must be so because they express the necessary polarity inherent in every self-regulating system. They can never be solved, but only outgrown.\n*Carl Jung*",

        "text": "Here are five sets of questions, drawn from our book The Art of Waking People Up: Cultivating Awareness and Authenticity at Work, that you can consider in assessing your own motivation. These questions can help you identify possible sources of compulsion or addiction to solving problems, and think a bit more carefully about the approach you would like to use in resolving your conflicts:\n\nYou have learned countless ways of solving problems. How well have you learned not to solve them? How willing are you to live with paradox, riddle, polarity, and enigma? Do you understand that by solving your problems too quickly, you could cheat yourself out of learning from them?\n\nYou have solved thousands of problems and learned a great deal in your life. How open are you to discovering that what you have learned is irrelevant or wrong? How do you stay in touch with your ignorance? How good are you at unlearning? How able are you to live in the present without being caught up in past problems or future solutions?\n\nYou know how to make things happen. Do you know how to let them happen naturally and fluidly on their own? Do you know how to not intervene? Can you let things happen to you, or simply watch them as they happen? Are you addicted to controlling the outcome or the process?\n\nYou understand a great deal about what is. Do you also understand what is not, and what could be? Do you see not only what, but who is in front of you? Do you understand that what you understand includes the nature of your own understanding?\n\nYou have developed a number of strengths and achieved successes. Do you recognize that for every strength there is a corresponding weakness? Do you understand that continued success leads to complacency, while failure leads to learning and change? Are you certain about what is success and what is failure?"

This vision encompasses who the product is being built for, why they need it, and how they will use it.\n\nThere is a natural tension between the product owner and the rest of the team; the product owner always wants more, and the team must defend its sustainable pace . This tension is healthy, so long as neither side dominates.\n\n“You must recognize that through your actions — writing user stories and acceptance tests , prioritizing user stories by business value , deciding which user stories are developed next , providing rapid feedback , etc — you are effectively steering the project and are ultimately responsible for the business value that is delivered . As the driving force behind the project your presence must be visible , vocal and objective .”",

        "text": "**Chapter 1. UNDERSTAND THE CULTURE AND DYNAMICS OF CONFLICT**\n\nA key point into how to resolve a conflict revolves around this concept of how we respond to the conflict itself.\n\nFight or flight is a normal and natural evolution response - this promotes 2 of the most un-productive ways we treat conflicts. Adrenaline is the fight hormone but there is also Oxytocin that is the referred to as the bonding chemical.\n\nThe key response ways into a conflict are listed in the picture below - but there is a potential trap here:\nIf B can find a way to listen, discover, and satisfy A's legitimate interests while not rewarding A's aggressive behaviors or taking them personally, even by silent acquiescence, in most cases A's aggression will gradually disappear.\n\nIn order to promote more collaboration:\n\n1. Start with a positive onset. See the conflict as a positive experience with potential positive outcomes.\n2. Use empathy to put yourself in the other person shoes and determine the objectives of all parties.\n3. Shift focus from power and defensive positioning to shared responsibility and satisfying both sides interests.\n4. Try to resolve all the underlying issues and not just the surface one.\n5. Be honest and give empathetic feedback.\n6. Have integrity and clarity and speak and act on them,\n7. Create small bridges between parties.\n",

Talk to them *after the event* and *talk to them in private*.\n\n*Describe the behavior, explain the consequences, make a request.*\n\nPeople are not aware of their behavior and giving feedback is the first thing to try.\n\n*Customer that is angry*\n\nFirst thing to try is to show empathy. I can see you are angry vs. I understand that you are angry.\nSecond thing is task related control. Focus on taking control on the task and the results. You need to manage your own anger.\n\n*Manager that does not give you support or maybe even impairing you*\n\nAsserting theory says - when I am acting in a way I am respecting your rights and also acting on my rights.\n\n*Someone that disrupts the workplace*\n\nWhat are we rewarding?\n\n",

Change from a Win-Lose to a Win-Win.\n\nTake some time out when emotions are involved. Get our of blaming. Work together in this?\n\nYou have to be very careful on blame statements because they perpetuate the spiral. It is so tempting do say \"I don't want to fight with you\" with the tone of blame - we are fighting because of you.\n\nGetting angry, blaming, aggression are all good signs we are in a conflict.\n\nSpend time listening. Active listening. Summarize the problem in a non-judgemental way.\n\nUncover the real issues.\n\nWhat a person says is they want is not what they need. Separate the position from the need. This is a way to be creative about finding the problem.\n\n*Example: A manager that needs time and a customer support officer that needs the skills needed. They compromise but it does not help. So how would the creative part look like? Identifying the real needs. Maybe some skills or someone else*",

Run the tests as often as possible. That way you will know quickly if your changes have broken anything.\n3. Take short, deliberate steps: move a field from one class to another, fuse two similar methods into a superclass. Refactoring often involves making many localized changes that result in a larger-scale change. If you keep your steps small, and test after each step, you will avoid prolonged debugging.",

        "text": "As a program evolves, it will become necessary to rethink earlier decisions and rework portions of the code. This process is perfectly natural. Code needs to evolve; it's not a static thing.\n\nUnfortunately, the most common metaphor for software development is building construction (Bertrand Meyer [Mey97b] uses the term \"Software Construction\"). But using construction as the guiding metaphor implies these steps:\n\nAn architect draws up blueprints.\nContractors dig the foundation, build the superstructure, wire and plumb, and apply finishing touches.\nThe tenants move in and live happily ever after, calling building maintenance to fix any problems.\nWell, software doesn't quite work that way. Rather than construction, software is more like gardening—it is more organic than concrete. You plant many things in a garden according to an initial plan and conditions. Some thrive, others are destined to end up as compost. You may move plantings relative to each other to take advantage of the interplay of light and shadow, wind and rain. Overgrown plants get split or pruned, and colors that clash may get moved to more aesthetically pleasing locations. You pull weeds, and you fertilize plantings that are in need of some extra help. You constantly monitor the health of the garden, and make adjustments (to the soil, the plants, the layout) as needed.\n\nBusiness people are comfortable with the metaphor of building construction: it is more scientific than gardening, it's repeatable, there's a rigid reporting hierarchy for management, and so on. But we're not building skyscrapers—we aren't as constrained by the boundaries of physics and the real world.\n\nThe gardening metaphor is much closer to the realities of software development. Perhaps a certain routine has grown too large, or is trying to accomplish too much—it needs to be split into two. Things that don't work out as planned need to be weeded or pruned.\n\nRewriting, reworking, and re-architecting code is collectively known as refactoring."

        "text": "**How to Program Deliberately**\n\nWe want to spend less time churning out code, catch and fix errors as early in the development cycle as possible, and create fewer errors to begin with. It helps if we can program deliberately:\n\n* Always be aware of what you are doing. Fred let things get slowly out of hand, until he ended up boiled, like the frog in Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs, page 7.\n* Don't code blindfolded. Attempting to build an application you don't fully understand, or to use a technology you aren't familiar with, is an invitation to be misled by coincidences.\n* Proceed from a plan, whether that plan is in your head, on the back of a cocktail napkin, or on a wall-sized printout from a CASE tool.\n* Rely only on reliable things. Don't depend on accidents or assumptions. If you can't tell the difference in particular circumstances, assume the worst.\n* Document your assumptions. Design by Contract, page 109, can help clarify your assumptions in your own mind, as well as help communicate them to others.\n* Don't just test your code, but test your assumptions as well. Don't guess; actually try it. Write an assertion to test your assumptions (see Assertive Programming, page 122). If your assertion is right, you have improved the documentation in your code. If you discover your assumption is wrong, then count yourself lucky.\n* Prioritize your effort. Spend time on the important aspects; more than likely, these are the hard parts. If you don't have fundamentals or infrastructure correct, brilliant bells and whistles will be irrelevant.\n* Don't be a slave to history. Don't let existing code dictate future code. All code can be replaced if it is no longer appropriate. Even within one program, don't let what you've already done constrain what you do next—be ready to refactor (see Refactoring, page 184). This decision may impact the project schedule. The assumption is that the impact will be less than the cost of not making the change.",

      "desc": "by Jurgen Appelo\n\n\"Never forget that better principles, not better practices, are what organizations really need.\"\n\nA great book on the subject. After finishing quite a lot of articles, books, information on the subject I can say that the book is a good summary to it all. It is a book on motivation, on keeping people engaged and happy. Full of nice Appelo things I would recommend it to mostly everyone interested in the topic.\n\nConvincing managers of the benefits of new ideas is best done by delivering on commitment in order to create trust, always trying to solve your manager's problem first, and experimenting with new ideas in safe-to-fail environments.\n\nKnowing that it is all about how the entire system acts on individuals, and how individuals act on the entire system, has made me more confident and systematic as a project manager and as a change manager. I know that what I need to do is to locally construct just enough boundaries and feedback mechanisms to get going and improve from there. My managers are impressed and I enjoy my work. An identity as ‘the project wizard' has stayed with me.",

      "desc": "The book is about transaction analysis - a system of popular psychology based on the idea that one's behavior and social relationships reflect an interchange between parental (critical and nurturing), adult (rational), and childlike (intuitive and dependent) aspects of personality established early in life.\n\nIn the field of psychoanalytic theories, with significant criticism around the subject this book is great because of the fact that it gives perspectives to how we human think and behave. \n\nThe idea that all of us carry with us a Parent, and Adult and a Child and that most dysfunctional communication happends when strange boundaries are crossed (for example a Child speak to an Adult) is something I feel has a lot of logic.\n\nI recommend this book to somebody interested in expanding perspectives on psychology but I don't think this is a manual of how and what a Scrum Master should act.\n\nI would consider it a book for an Advanced-Beginner (maybe) but mostly for a competent Scrum Master.",

      "desc": "Pretty good MOOC on the subject of relationship management.\n\nSplit into 4 modules:\n\n1. Coaching and counseling others\n2. Building power and influence\n3. Managing conflict\n4. Conducting effective meetings\n\nIt is a good overview on the subject. It could be better organized.\n\nThe support book which is Developing Management Skills (8th Edition) by David A. Whetten, Kim S. Cameron seems like a good book on Management and I would recommend the assessments it has at the end of chapters and that are also demanded in the course.",

I would have settled for a summary, or key ideas from the book. \nI think I am not open to the ideas presented here therefore I find them difficult to incorporate in the overall thinking.\n\nI am not sure I would recommend it to someone on an SM level. To me this book is important for C-level functions in order to have an understanding and method on how transformation, and continuous transformation needs to be applied in today's context in order to make things work.\n\n\"In other words, just as The Lean Startup argued for a shift in thinking from innovation to continuous innovation, I hope this book will leave you with a hunger not only for transformation but for continuous transformation.\"",
